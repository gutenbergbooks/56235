      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Antelope had
      traversed all the waters of the Baie de Chaleur, and the enterprising
      voyageurs on board had met with many adventures by sea and land; and at
      length all these were exhausted, and, as the time drew near for their
      departure, the question arose where next to go, which question was
      discussed in full council assembled upon the deck; present Bruce, Arthur,
      Bart, Tom, Phil, Pat, Captain Corbet, Wade, and Solomon, Bruce being in
      the chair&mdash;that is to say, on the taffrail. &ldquo;All you that are in
      favor of going home, say &lsquo;Ay&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bruce. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence. Not one spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to go about it,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t parliamentary.
      Let&rsquo;s do business regularly. Come. I rise, Mr. President, to make a
      motion. I move that the B. O. W. C. continue their wanderings as long as
      the holidays last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second that motion,&rdquo; cried Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it has been moved and seconded that the B. O. W.
      C. continue their wanderings as long as the holidays last. All that are in
      favor of this motion will please manifest it by saying, &lsquo;Ay.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this there was a universal chorus of &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contrary minds, &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a vote,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;and now all that remains to do is to decide
      upon the direction to be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Captain Corbet smiled benignly, and a glance of approval beamed
      from his venerable eye. Old Solomon grinned violently, but checked himself
      in a moment; his grin was drowned in a low chuckle, and he exclaimed, &ldquo;De
      sakes now, chil&rsquo;en alive, how you do go on! Mos&rsquo; make dis ole nigga bust
      hisself to see dese yer mynouvrins.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, boys,&rdquo; cried Bart, suddenly dropping altogether the
      &ldquo;parliamentary&rdquo; style in which he had last spoken; &ldquo;what do you say to a
      cruise around the gulf? Let&rsquo;s visit the islands; there are ever so many;
      some of them are uninhabited, too. It&rsquo;ll be glorious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious&mdash;will it?&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Wait, my boy, till you know as much
      about uninhabited islands as I do. You don&rsquo;t catch me putting my foot
      ashore on anything of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, we needn&rsquo;t be particular about the inhabitants,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;I
      go in for islands, head over heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be the powers,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s meself that howlds up both hands to
      that same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we go to the Magdalen Islands,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re right in the
      middle of the gulf, and it&rsquo;s a very queer place, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;if we go anywhere, let&rsquo;s go to Anticosti. For my
      part, I&rsquo;ve always been wild to go to Anticosti. I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s
      another island in all the world that&rsquo;s equal to it. It&rsquo;s cold, bleak,
      gloomy, uninhabited, and full of ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of fiddlesticks!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur. &ldquo;What do you want of ghosts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, placidly, &ldquo;for my part, I think there is something
      uncommonly interesting in a haunted island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A haunted island!&rdquo; repeated Arthur. &ldquo;Well, my boy, all I&rsquo;ve got to say
      is, that if you want anything of that sort, you&rsquo;ll find the best specimen
      on Sable Island; so I propose that we go there at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sable Island? Why, man alive, that&rsquo;s ever so far away!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
      better wait till we&rsquo;re on our way home, and leave that for the last;
      though, for my part, I think we&rsquo;d better give it a wide berth. I go in for
      some of the gulf islands&mdash;St. Paul, for instance, or St. Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;since you&rsquo;re all so crazy about islands, why
      can&rsquo;t we go to the Bay of Islands at once? We can have our fill of them
      there, I should think. For my part I&rsquo;m indifferent. I&rsquo;m like Tom; I&rsquo;ve had
      my turn at a desert island, and have found out the vanity of Robinson
      Crusoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, thin,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;and whin we&rsquo;re about it, we&rsquo;d betther take the
      biggist island we can find about here, and that same is Newfoundland.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t it be betther to begin with that, thin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, with the air of a judge or an umpire,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to make up our minds to visit all these islands. Each one has
      his preference, and each one shall be gratified. You, Bart, may see
      Anticosti; you, Arthur, may see Sable Island; you, Tom, may visit St. Paul
      and St. Peter; you, Phil, may visit the Bay of Islands; and at the same
      time you, Pat, may see Newfoundland. Of course, then, I hope to go to the
      Magdalen Islands. Now, as we are going to visit all these places, and the
      Magdalen Islands happen to be nearest, we will take them first, while we
      may visit in turn Anticosti and the others, winding up with Sable Island,
      which may be postponed to the last, since it is the farthest off. We may
      make up our minds, boys, to no end of adventures. We&rsquo;re all in first-rate
      training; we are hardened by adventures on sea and on shore; we can live
      on next to nothing; and I&rsquo;m only sorry that we&rsquo;re not a little nearer to
      the North Pole, so that we might set out now as we are to settle the
      question forever about the open Polar Sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The extravagant notion with which Bruce closed his address was received
      with shouts of laughter and applause. Then followed a confused
      conversation. At length they all gathered around Captain Corbet, who had
      thus far been a listener, and began to question him about the various
      places which they proposed to visit. The answer of the venerable navigator
      was not very satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you put me down in any part of old Fundy, an I&rsquo;m to
      hum; anywhar&rsquo;s between the head of old Fundy an Bosting, I know it all be
      heart; an I engage to feel my way in fog or in darkness, or in
      snow-storms, backard an forard, year on an year on; but jest about here
      I&rsquo;m all agog. In these here parts I&rsquo;m a pilgerrim an a stranger, an ain&rsquo;t
      particularly to be trusted. But I can navigate the Antelope all the same,
      an fool round in these waters as long as you like. I ain&rsquo;t got any chart,
      terrew; but I&rsquo;ve got an old map of Canady, an kin scrape along with that,
      especially this season of the year. I kin git a ginral leadin idee of the
      position of places, an work along the old Antelope wharever you want to
      go. I&rsquo;m an old man myself, an don&rsquo;t mind this kerrewsing a bit; in fact,
      it&rsquo;s rayther agree&rsquo;ble. The best of it is, we&rsquo;re allus sure to fetch up
      some-whar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This frank announcement of Captain Corbet&rsquo;s ignorance of these seas might
      have excited disquietude in the bosoms of less enterprising lads; but the
      cruisers of the Antelope had seen and known, and felt and suffered, too
      much to be easily disturbed. Of Captain Corbet&rsquo;s confession they thought
      nothing whatever, nor indeed did it really matter very much to them
      whether he was acquainted with these waters or not. After all, they were
      not particular about any destination; any mistakes which he might make
      would not create any inconvenience to them; and even if, in seeking to
      reach Newfoundland, he should land them at Cape Cod, they would not much
      care. Under these circumstances they listened to his words with
      indifference, and if they felt any disappointment, it was because they
      were unable to gain from him any information whatever about the places
      which they proposed to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since they could gain no information, they did not waste much more time in
      conversation, but concluded to set out without delay. And so in a little
      while the Antelope spread her white wings, and began to walk the waters in
      her usual style, like a thing of life, and all that. In process of time
      she reached the entrance of the bay, and then passed out into the gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious day. The wind was fair. The Antelope did her best. The
      sun went down that evening behind the high hills, and before them lay a
      wide expanse of water. On the following morning they saw land ahead. The
      land was an island, or a cluster of islands, and all the boys felt certain
      that it was the Magdalen Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of Captain Corbet&rsquo;s ignorance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, he had
      chosen his course very accurately, for this was indeed their destination.
      As the schooner drew nearer and nearer, the boys looked with curious eyes
      upon this remote and isolated spot, situated in the midst of the Gulf of
      St. Lawrence, and shut out during all the winter months from the rest of
      the world of man by ice, and storms, and solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind died away after sunrise, and hours passed before they came near
      enough to think of landing. At length the anchor was dropped, and the boat
      was made ready to go ashore. From this point they could see this new land
      to the best advantage. They saw before them an island rising high out of
      the water, with its green slopes covered with grass, and crowned with
      trees, and dotted with white houses. Before them there were a cove and a
      sandy beach, upon which boats were drawn up. The other islands of the
      group were shut out from view by this one. Not far away&mdash;in fact, not
      farther than a stone&rsquo;s throw&mdash;there lay another schooner at anchor.
      Very different was this other schooner from the Antelope. The Antelope, in
      spite of its many admirable and amiable qualities, was not particularly
      distinguished either for size, or strength, or speed, or beauty. In every
      one of these particulars the other schooner was the exact opposite. It was
      large; it was evidently new; its lines were sharp and delicate, indicating
      great speed; its spread of canvas was immense; it was a model of naval
      architecture; while the freshness of its paint, and the extreme neatness
      which appeared in every part, indicated a far greater care on the part of
      its master than any which the good and gracious Corbet was ever disposed
      to exhibit towards his beloved Antelope. On high floated the Stars and
      Stripes, exhibiting the nationality of the stranger. On her stern the boys
      could read her name and nation. They saw there, in white letters
      underneath a gold eagle, the words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      FAWN-GLOUCESTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On land,&rdquo; said Bruce, gravely, as he looked at the strange craft, &ldquo;the
      Antelope and the Fawn are somewhat alike; but on the sea it strikes me
      that there is a slight difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boys said nothing, but there arose involuntarily in the mind of
      each a feeling not exactly of envy, but at least a fervent wish that the
      resemblance which Bruce spoke of should exist on the water as well as on
      the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a yacht,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a cruiser,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin of the kind,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;That thar craft ain&rsquo;t anythin
      more than a Gloucester fishing schewner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fishing schooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course; an why not? Why, them Gloucester skippers make themselves
      comfortable; they know how to do it, tew, an this chap is jest like the
      rest. He makes himself comfortable, keeps his schewner like a palace or a
      parlor, an don&rsquo;t let even so much as the scale of a red herrin be seen
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys went ashore in the boat. Bruce then returned for Captain Corbet,
      who was touched by this small attention. As Bart and the rest waited on
      the beach, they noticed a small, neat, freshly-painted boat drawn up not
      far away, which needed not the name of Fawn on the stern to assure them
      that it could belong to nothing else than the smart schooner. While they
      were looking at it and admiring it, a man advanced towards them, who
      regarded them with a puzzled and curious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of middle age and medium stature, with clean-shaven face,
      close-cut hair, and keen gray eye. He wore a dark-blue frock coat and
      wide-awake hat, and did not seem at all like a seaman; yet somehow the
      boys could not help feeling that this very neatly-dressed man must have
      something to do with the Fawn. He came up to them, and looked at them with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who in thunder are you, anyhow?&rdquo; he exclaimed, at length. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make
      you out at all. You belong to that queer-looking tub out there, I see; but
      who you are and what you are after is beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This style of address struck the boys as being rather uncivil; but the
      good-natured expression of the stranger&rsquo;s face showed that no incivility
      was meant, and won their hearts at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Bart, with a laugh, &ldquo;you must never judge by appearances,
      you know. We&rsquo;re not a fishing vessel. In fact, we&rsquo;re a sort of chartered
      yacht, though we&rsquo;re a very unpretending sort of yacht, and we don&rsquo;t go in
      for show. We&rsquo;re a schooner, cruising about in a plain, off-hand, homely
      manner for pleasure, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the stranger burst into a shout of laughter, which was so cheery,
      and so hearty, and so good-natured, that the boys found it impossible to
      resist its contagion, and at length they all joined in also, though why
      they were laughing, or what they were laughing at, they had not the
      smallest idea in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, boys,&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, at length, as soon as he had
      recovered from his laughter; &ldquo;excuse me, but I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ll knock
      under. I cave in. I don&rsquo;t understand it at all. Have you a looking-glass
      aboard your tub out there? Has any one of you any idea what he looks like?
      Or have you ever examined one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the boys could not help looking at one another, and at themselves,
      and at this survey they began to perceive what they had not at all
      suspected&mdash;that they were one and all a most disreputable-looking
      crowd. Their clothes were torn and stained with mud, and gave signs in
      every seam and fibre of long scrambles through wood and water, and long
      struggles with the elements. But, in fact, no one of them had thought of
      this until this moment, when they found themselves confronted and laughed
      at by this well-dressed stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the shabbiness,&rdquo; cried the stranger, &ldquo;that upsets me, but it&rsquo;s
      the contrast&mdash;such faces looking at me out of such clothes! Do your
      mothers know you are out? or, in other words, boys, do your parents know
      the particular way in which you are moving about the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not a vain vessel, you know. We&rsquo;re only a
      plain, simple, matter-of-fact potato schooner, out for a holiday, and on
      the lookout for a little fun. We&rsquo;re not proud, and so, perhaps, being a
      potato schooner, it&rsquo;s just as well not to be too particular about clothes.
      We&rsquo;ve always been told not to think too much about dress; and besides,
      this sort of thing is ever so much more convenient for roughing it, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I dare say you looked very well when you
      started; and after all, clothes are not the most important thing. At any
      rate, I&rsquo;m glad to meet you! How d&rsquo;ye do, all? I&rsquo;m glad to see you! How
      d&rsquo;ye do? I&rsquo;d like to know you. My name&rsquo;s Ferguson, Tobias Ferguson, and
      I&rsquo;m skipper of that there craft, the Fawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he shook hands with every one of the boys in succession,
      asked their names, their ages, their place of abode, the names,
      occupations, and ages of their parents, and then proceeded to inquire
      about their adventures thus far, and their intentions in the future. By
      this time Bruce had returned from the vessel with Captain Corbet, to whom
      Ferguson at once made himself known; and thus in a short time he had come
      to be on intimate terms with all the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just dropped in here to Magdalen,&rdquo; said he, frankly, &ldquo;to fix up the
      Fawn a bit. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much of a place, any ways. The people air a lot
      of beggarly, frog-eating Frenchmen, that follow fashions as old as Adam.
      When Adam delved and Eve span, as the old verse says, they had a plough
      and a spindle, and that thar identical plough and spindle air still in use
      here among these here French. You can&rsquo;t make em use anythin else. Why,
      I&rsquo;ve been here dozens of times, and I&rsquo;ve tried, to get em to give up their
      old-fashioned ways, and be up to the age. I&rsquo;ve showed em our way of doin
      things. No go. Not a mite of use. Might as well talk to a stone wall.
      They&rsquo;ll never get out of the old rut. And see what they&rsquo;re doin here! Why,
      only look around you! Magdalen Islands! Why, this locality is one of the
      most favored on this green earth. In the middle of this gulf, right in the
      track of ships, it is in a position to enter upon a career of progress
      that might make this place one of the most flourishing in the world. They
      might control the whole fish trade; they might originate new modes of
      fishing. Why, look at me! I&rsquo;ve tried to get em to start factories, build
      railroads, steamboats, common schools, hotels, newspapers, electric
      telegraphs, and other concomitants of our nineteenth century civilization.
      And what&rsquo;s the result? Why, nothing. I might as well talk to the wind.
      Railroads! electric telegraphs! Why, you might as well ask them to build a
      bridge to the moon! Well, all I can say is, that these here Magdalen
      Islands won&rsquo;t ever be anythin till they fall in with the sperrit of the
      age. Them&rsquo;s my sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Railroads!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;Why, what could they do with a railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; exclaimed Ferguson. &ldquo;Why, develop their resources, promote trade,
      facilitate intercourse, and keep themselves abreast with the age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are not more than a couple of thousand people on the islands,&rdquo;
       said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the odds? So much the more reason for them to be up and
      doin,&rdquo; retorted Ferguson, with some warmth. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all as poor as rats;
      and a railroad is the only thing that can save them from eventooly dyin
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked at the stranger in some perplexity, for they did not know
      whether he&rsquo; could really be in earnest or not. But from Ferguson&rsquo;s face
      and manner they could gather nothing whatever. He seemed perfectly
      serious, and altogether in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he repeated, emphatically, &ldquo;these here Magdalen Islands&rsquo;ll
      never be wuth anythin till they get a railroad. Them&rsquo;s my sentiments.&rdquo;

      that their new acquaintance was so very friendly, and communicative, and
      all that, the boys thought that it would be a good thing to find out from
      him something about the various islands which they proposed visiting.
      Ferguson declared that he knew as much about the Gulf of St. Lawrence as
      any man living, and could tell them all they wanted to know. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a place is St. Paul&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper shook his head in silence. &ldquo;Is St. Pierre worth visiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;scarcely,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a place is Anticosti?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d best not go within fifty miles of that thar island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a place is Sable Island?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sable Island!&rdquo; exclaimed the skipper, staring at them in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Cape Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we mean Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper looked at them all with a solemn face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as to visiting Sable Island, all I&rsquo;ve got to say
      is, I hope you&rsquo;ll never begin to try it on Sable Island. Why, Sable
      Island&rsquo;s one of the places that seafarin&rsquo; men try never to visit, and pray
      never to get nearer than a hundred miles to. Sable Island! Boys,&rdquo; he
      continued, after a pause, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ever speak of that again; don&rsquo;t even
      think of it. Give it up at once and forever. I only hope that you won&rsquo;t be
      brought to pay a visit there in spite of yourselves, a thing which I&rsquo;m
      afraid you&rsquo;re very likely to do if you go cruisin&rsquo; about in an old tub
      like that much longer. Not but what Sable Island mightn&rsquo;t be improved&mdash;that
      is, if the inhabitants only had any enterprise, and the government that
      owns it was alive to the wants of the age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Inhabitants!&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;why, there&rsquo;s only the keeper and his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper waved his hand.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Grant all that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Very well. They&rsquo;re a nucleus, at any rate, and
      can give tone and character to the future Sable Islanders. Now, what your
      government ought to do with Sable Island is this. They&rsquo;d ought to make a
      good breakwater, first and foremost, so as to have decent harbor
      accommodation for passing vessels. Then they&rsquo;d ought to connect it with
      the main land with a submarine cable, so that the place needn&rsquo;t be quite
      so isolated, and have regular lines of steamers runnin&rsquo; backard and
      forard. Well, then they ought to get up a judicious emigration scheme, and
      that thar island would begin to go ahead in a style that would make you
      fairly open your eyes. Why, in ten years, if this plan was carried out,
      they&rsquo;d be building a railroad,&mdash;a thing that is needed there more
      than most anywheres, the island bein so uncommon long and narrow,&mdash;and
      that bein done, why, Sable Island would begin to come abreast of the
      nineteenth century, instead of hanging back in the middle ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation of a similar character, the skipper
      proposed to show the boys about the country, and introduce them to some of
      the &ldquo;aristocracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is one of them, now. It&rsquo;s the priest&mdash;and a
      precious fine fellow he is, any how, and no mistake. He is priest,
      governor general, magistrate, constable, policeman, Sunday school teacher,
      town clerk, schoolmaster, newspaper, lawyer, doctor, notary public, census
      taker, and fifty other things all rolled into one. He is the factotum of
      the Magdalen Islands. They come to him for everything: to baptize their
      infants, to marry their young couples, and to bury their dead. They go to
      mass on Sundays, and on week days they go to him for advice and assistance
      in everything. He visits the sick, and administers medicine as doctor, or
      extreme unction as priest. He settles all their quarrels better than any
      judge or jury, and there never ain&rsquo;t any appeal thought of from his
      decision. Now, all this is what I call a species of despotism,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      one man power, but it suits these poor benighted frog-eatin heathen,&mdash;and,
      besides, it&rsquo;s no more a despotism than the father of a family exercises.
      It&rsquo;s patriarchal&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is. It&rsquo;s wonderful, too, how much
      honor the young people hereabouts pay to their fathers, and grandfathers,
      and elders genrally. I never knowed anythin like it in all my born days.
      Well, now, boys, mind you, all this is goin to be upset. Some day they&rsquo;ll
      be appointin magistrates here, and doctors will come, and lawyers; then
      this little community will all be sot by the ears, and&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll
      enter upon a career of boundless progress. They&rsquo;ll get the ballot-box, and
      the newspaper, and all the concomitants of modern civilization; the
      present patriarchal system&rsquo;ll be played out, and the spirit of the age
      will reign and rule over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time the skipper had given utterance to this, they had approached
      the priest. He was a mild, venerable man, with a meek face and a genial
      smile. He spoke English very well, shook hands with all, and listened to
      the skipper&rsquo;s explanations about their present visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, boys, I&rsquo;ll leave you for the present,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;to the
      care of Father Leblanc, who will do the honors of the island. I&rsquo;ve got to
      go aboard the Fawn to fix up a few things. We&rsquo;ll meet again in the course
      of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he went down to the beach. The shabbiness of the costume
      of the boys had already excited the remarks of the skipper, but the good
      Father Leblanc soon saw that in spite of this they were clever and
      intelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not often have,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at this place visitors above the rank of
      fishermen, and we have never before had any visitors like you. I can
      assure you a welcome, dear boys, from all the good people here. There is
      to be a fête to-day in honor of the marriage of two of my flock. Would you
      like to go? If so, I invite you most cordially, and assure you of a
      welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This unexpected invitation, thus kindly given, was accepted with
      undisguised eagerness; and thereupon the boys accompanied the priest, who
      first of all went to his own home, where he offered them some simple
      refreshments. The priest&rsquo;s home was a small cottage of very unpretending
      exterior, and very similar to all the other cottages; but inside there
      were marks of refined taste and scholarly pursuits. A few Latin and Greek
      classics were on a small book-shelf. There was an harmonium, with some
      volumes of sacred music, and here and there were some volumes which were
      of a theological character. The entertainment of the priest consisted of
      some coffee, which the boys were surprised to find, and which they
      afterwards unanimously pronounced to be &ldquo;perfectly delicious,&rdquo; and some
      fresh eggs, with immaculate bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After chatting with the boys for about an hour, the priest announced that
      it was time to start, as their destination was on the opposite side of the
      island. They accordingly set out at once, and walked along the slope of a
      hill. There was no road, but only a footpath, which served all the
      purposes of the Magdalen Islanders, in spite of the skipper&rsquo;s theories
      about a railway. On the way the priest entertained them with stories of
      his life on these secluded islands, of the storms of winter, of the ice
      blockade, of the perils of the sea, of the vast solitude of the
      surrounding gulf, where in winter no ship ever ventures. Yet in spite of
      the loneliness, he affirmed that no one here had any sense of desolation,
      for it seemed to all of the inhabitants, just as it seems to the
      inhabitants of other countries, that this home of theirs was the centre of
      the universe, and all other lands strange, and drear, and unattractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they reached their destination. It was a cottage of rather
      larger size than usual, and it seemed as if the whole population of the
      island had gathered here. Tables were spread in the open air, and a barrel
      of cider was on tap. As they drew near they heard the sound of a fiddle,
      and saw figures moving about in a lively dance. Old men, young men, women,
      girls, and children were all laughing, talking, dancing, or playing. It
      was a scene full of a curious attractiveness, and exhibited in a striking
      way the irrepressible gayety that characterizes the French wherever they
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their approach the laughter and the dance ceased for a time, and the
      company welcomed the good priest with smiles and kindly words. The boys
      also came in for a share of the hospitable welcome, and as soon as the
      priest had explained who they were, they were at once received as most
      welcome and honored guests. Unfortunately the boys could not speak a word
      of French, and the people could not speak a word of English, so that there
      was not that freedom of intercourse between the two parties which might
      have been desirable; but the priest did much to bring about this
      interchange of feelings by acting as interpreter, and the boys also by
      gestures or by smiles endeavored, not without some success, to make known
      their feelings for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys soon distributed themselves about at random, and the good people
      never ceased to pay delicate little attentions to them by offering them
      coffee or cakes, by uttering a few words in the hope that they might be
      understood, or, if words were wanting, they took refuge in smiles. But
      words were not wanting, and different members of the party made violent
      efforts to break through the restraints which a foreign language imposed,
      and express their feelings more directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Captain Corbet, who had accompanied the party, finding himself
      hospitably entertained by a smiling old Frenchman, endeavored to make
      known the joy of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; said he, tapping his cup and grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui, oui,&rdquo; said the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee dood&mdash;pooty&mdash;nicey&mdash;O, velly nicey picey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet evidently was falling back upon his &ldquo;baby talk,&rdquo; under the
      impression that it would be more intelligible to a foreigner. But this
      foreigner did not quite understand him. He only shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cooky&mdash;cakey&mdash;nicey,&rdquo; continued Captain Corbet, in, an amiable
      tone. &ldquo;All dood&mdash;all nicey&mdash;velly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he again paused and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plait-il?&rdquo; said the Frenchman, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plate? O, no, no plate for me, an thank you kindly all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman looked at him in a bewildered way, but still smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vouley vous du pain?&rdquo; he asked, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pan?&rdquo; said Captain Corbet; &ldquo;pan? Course not. What&rsquo;d I do with a pan?&mdash;but
      thankin you all the same, course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a pooty &rsquo;itile tottage,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, resuming his
      baby talk, &ldquo;an a pooty tompany, an it was all dood&mdash;pooty&mdash;nicey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Frenchman didn&rsquo;t understand a word, and so at length Captain
      Corbet, with a sigh, gave up the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the others were making similar endeavors. Tom had got hold of a
      French boy about his own age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parley vous Français,&rdquo; said Tom, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui,&rdquo; said the French boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui, moosoo,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French boy smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merci, madame,&rdquo; continued Tom, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nong&mdash;tong&mdash;paw,&rdquo; proceeded Tom, in a business-like manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this the boy could evidently make nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here Tom seemed to have reached the limit of his knowledge of French,
      and the conversation came to a sudden and lamentable end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart had carried on for some time an interesting conversation with smiles
      and gestures, when he too ventured into audible words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon!&rdquo; said he, in an impressive manner; and then touching the breast of
      the boy to whom he was speaking, he continued, &ldquo;You&mdash;tu&mdash;you
      know&mdash;you&rsquo;re bon;&rdquo; then, laying his hand on his heart, he said, &ldquo;me
      bon;&rdquo; then, pointing to the cup, &ldquo;coffee bon;&rdquo; then sweeping his hand
      around, he added, &ldquo;and all bon&mdash;house bon, company bon, people bon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, oui,&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;Oui, je vous comprends. Aha, oui, la bonne
      compagnie, le bon peuple&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon company, bon people, bon company, bon people,&rdquo; cried Bart, delighted
      at his success in getting up a conversation; &ldquo;bon coffee, too; I tell you
      what, it&rsquo;s the bonnest coffee that I&rsquo;ve tasted for many a long day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the boy looked blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parley vous Français?&rdquo; asked Bart, in an anxious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;but the moment I get home I intend to
      study it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at this stage Bart&rsquo;s conversation broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat chose another mode of accomplishing the same end. Captain Corbet had
      been acting on the theory that foreigners were like babies, and could
      understand baby talk. Pat, in addition to this, acted on the theory that
      they were deaf, and had to be addressed accordingly. So, as he was
      refreshing himself with coffee and cakes, he drew a little nearer to the
      old woman who had poured it out for him, and bent down his head. The old
      woman was at that moment intent upon her coffeepot, and did not notice
      Pat. Suddenly Pat, with his mouth close to her ear, shouted out with a
      perfect yell,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you! and thank you kindly, marm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a shriek of terror the startled old woman sprang up and fell
      backward. The chair on which she had been sitting, a rather rickety
      affair, gave way and went down. The old lady fell with the chair upon the
      ground, and lay for a moment motionless. Pat, horror-struck, stood
      confounded, and stared in silence at the ruin he had wrought. The
      bystanders, alarmed at the shout and shriek, crowded around, and for a
      moment there was universal confusion. Among the bystanders was the priest.
      To him Pat turned in his despair, and tried to explain. The priest
      listened, and then went to see about the old woman. Fortunately she had
      fallen on the soft turf, and was not at all hurt. She was soon on her
      feet, and another chair was procured, in which she seated herself. The
      priest then explained the whole affair. Pat was fully forgiven, and the
      harmony of the festival was perfectly restored. But Pat&rsquo;s laudable efforts
      at maintaining a conversation had received so severe a check that he did
      not open his mouth for the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The festival went on. Fun and hilarity prevailed all around. The dancing
      grew more and more vigorous. At length the contagion spread to the elder
      ones of the party, and the boys were astonished to see old men stepping
      forth to skip and dance about the green; then old women came forward to
      take a part, until, at length, all were dancing. The boys stood as
      spectators, until at length Bart determined to throw himself into the
      spirit of the scene. He therefore found a partner, and plunged into the
      dance. The others followed. Captain Corbet alone remained, seated near a
      table, viewing the scene with his usual benevolent glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this festive scene the skipper approached. He walked with
      rapid steps, and, without hesitating an instant, seized a partner and
      flung himself, with all the energy of his race, into the mazy dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often dance, boys,&rdquo; he remarked, afterwards, &ldquo;but when I do, I
      mean business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that on this occasion the skipper did mean business. He
      danced more vigorously than any. He jumped higher; he whirled his partner
      round faster; he danced with more partners than any other, for he went
      through the whole assemblage, and led out every female there, from the
      oldest woman down to the smallest girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the time he chatted volubly, and flung out remarks which excited
      roars of laughter. He won all hearts. He was, in fact, an immense success.
      The boys wondered, for they had not imagined that he could speak French.
    </p>
    <p>
      He alluded to this afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a natral affinity with the French down in New England,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;When America was first colonized, our forefathers had to fight the French
      all the time. The two races were thus brought into connection. Our
      forefathers thus caught from the French that nasal twang with which the
      uneducated still speak English. You find that twang among the uneducated
      classes all over the British provinces and New England. It&rsquo;s French&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what it is. Corbet and I are both uneducated men, and we both speak
      English with the French twang. I speak French first rate; and Corbet there
      could speak it first rate also, if he only knew the language perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks the boys did not quite know how to take. The skipper seemed
      to have a bantering way with him, and spoke so oddly that it was
      impossible for them to make out half of the time whether he was in earnest
      or only in jest.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NOTHER day was passed very pleasantly at
      the Magdalen Islands, and then the boys concluded that they had seen about
      all that there was to be seen in this place. As the question where next to
      go arose, they Concluded to ask the skipper. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the first place, let me ask you if you&rsquo;ve ever
      heard of Anticosti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we have,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t go there; don&rsquo;t go near it; don&rsquo;t go within fifty mile of it;
      don&rsquo;t speak of it; don&rsquo;t think of it; and don&rsquo;t dream of it. It&rsquo;s a place
      of horror, a howling wilderness, the abomination of desolation, a haunted
      island, a graveyard of unfortunate sailors. Its shores are lined with
      their bones. Don&rsquo;t you go and add your young bones to the lot. You can do
      far better with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where do you advise us to go?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper thought for a few moments without answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart, in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the skipper, impressively, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go there; don&rsquo;t go within a
      hundred miles of it; don&rsquo;t speak of it; don&rsquo;t think of it; don&rsquo;t dream of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve said all that to us before,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;We want to know
      where we <i>are</i> to go, not where we are <i>not</i> to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;I am aware that I&rsquo;ve said all this before, and
      I say it a second time, deliberately, for the simple purpose of impressing
      it upon your minds. There&rsquo;s nothin like repetition to impress a thing on
      the memory; and so, if you ever come to grief on Anticosti, or on Sable
      Island, you&rsquo;ll remember my warnin, and you&rsquo;ll never feel like blamin me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where ought we to go?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the next point. Now, I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; all about it, and to
      my mind there ain&rsquo;t any place in all this here region that comes up to the
      Bay of Islands, Newfoundland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bay of Islands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Bay of Islands, on the west coast of Newfoundland. It&rsquo;s a great
      place. I&rsquo;ve been there over and over, and I know it like a book. Thousands
      of vessels go there every season. It&rsquo;s one of the best harbors in the
      gulf. It&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful places in the world. The air is
      bracing, the climate salubrious, the scenery inviting; and it only needs a
      first-class hotel with all the modern improvements in order to become a
      number one waterin-place. Yes, by ginger!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you plant a
      first-class hotel there, and let that there place become known, and
      there&rsquo;s nothin to prevent it from goin ahead of Long Branch or Newport, or
      any other place you can mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued the skipper, &ldquo;if you wanted to go any further, you might
      go up the Straits of Belle Isle, and round Newfoundland. If you had time,
      you might take a run over to Greenland; it&rsquo;s gettin to be quite a place, a
      fashionable resort in the hot summer; but perhaps you won&rsquo;t have time, and
      won&rsquo;t care about doin more than cruisin round Newfoundland, and then
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the skipper&rsquo;s tone seemed somewhat extravagant to the boys, and
      they did not know how to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to go to Greenland this season. When
      we do go there, we shall probably go for good; but just now, we want to
      confine ourselves to the gulf. If you can really recommend the Bay of
      Islands, perhaps we had better go there; that is,&rdquo; added Bart, &ldquo;unless you
      think we had better go to Iceland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper looked at Bart for a few moments in silence, and a smile
      gradually passed over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the identical place that I was
      just going to recommend, when you took the words out of my mouth. The fact
      is, boys, with that old tub of yours you might as well go to Iceland as
      anywhere else. Every time I look at it I am thunderstruck. What were your
      fathers and mothers thinkin of when they let you come away up here in such
      an old rattle-trap?&mdash;an old tub that isn&rsquo;t worth being condemned! Do
      you think you&rsquo;ll ever get home again in her? Not you. Do you know where
      that old tub&rsquo;s bound to go before the end of this season? Down to the
      bottom of the sea; and if you don&rsquo;t go in her, you may bless your lucky
      stars. I only wish I wasn&rsquo;t otherwise engaged. I&rsquo;d make you all clear out
      at once, and come aboard the Fawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet was not present, and did not hear these insulting
      reflections upon his beloved Antelope, and therefore was spared the pain
      which they would have caused to his aged bosom; but the boys were not the
      ones to listen to such insinuations in silence. The Antelope was dear to
      them from past associations, and they all began at once to vindicate her
      character. They talked long and eloquently about her. They spoke of her
      speed, soundness, and beauty. They told of her performances thus far.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all of which the skipper only grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words, boys,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that there tub is goin to the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if she does, she&rsquo;ll get up again,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinions of the two parties were so different that any further debate
      was useless. The skipper believed that they were bound for the bottom of
      the sea; the boys on the contrary had faith in the Antelope. The end of it
      all was, that they concluded to take the skipper&rsquo;s advice in part, and
      sail for the Bay of Islands. This place was one which they all were
      desirous of visiting, and they thought that when they had gone that far,
      they could then decide best where next to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to leave the next morning. That evening they took leave of the
      friendly skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll never meet again; but if you do get
      back safe from this perilous adventure of yours, and if any of you ever
      happen to be at Gloucester, Massachusetts, I do wish you&rsquo;d look me up, and
      let me know. I&rsquo;d give anything to see any one of you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the skipper shook hands with each one of them heartily,
      and so took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning the Antelope spread her sails and began
      once more to traverse the seas, heading towards the north. The wind was
      fair, and all that day they moved farther and farther away from the
      Magdalen Islands, until at length towards evening they were lost to view
      in distance and darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day they were all up early. They saw all around a boundless
      expanse of water. No land was anywhere visible, and not a sail was in
      sight. This was a novelty to the boys, for never yet had any of them had
      this experience in the Antelope. Some of them had been out of sight of
      land, it is true; but then they were in large ships, or ocean steamers.
      Being in such a situation in a craft like the Antelope, was a far
      different thing. Yet none of them felt anything like anxiety, nor had the
      slurs of the skipper produced any effect upon their affectionate trust in
      their gallant bark, and in their beloved Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly on the present occasion there was little enough cause for
      anxiety about the sea-worthiness of the Antelope. The sea was as smooth as
      a mirror, and its glassy surface extended far and wide around them. There
      was not a breath of air stirring. They learned from Wade that the wind had
      gradually died away between sundown and midnight, until it had ceased
      altogether. They were now in a dead calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the party was very well pleased at this. They all wished to be
      moving. They disliked calms, and would have much preferred a moderate gale
      of wind. The Antelope, however, was here, and there was no help for it.
      She was far away from land. She lay gently rising and falling, as the long
      ocean rollers raised her up and let her down; and her sails flapped idly
      in the still air, at the motion of the vessel. The boys did the best they
      could under the circumstances, and tried to pass away the time in various
      ways. Some of them tried to sleep; others extemporized a checker-board,
      and played till they were tired; others walked up and down, or lounged
      about. All of them, however, found their chief employment in one
      occupation, and that was eating. Ever since they had been on the water
      their appetites had been sharpened; and now that they had nothing else to
      do, the occupation of eating became more important and engrossing. To
      prolong the repast while it was before them as far as possible, and then
      to anticipate the next, were important aids towards killing the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day the calm continued: on going to bed that night, the boys
      confidently looked forward to a change of weather on the following day.
      The night was calm. The following day came. They were all up betimes. To
      their deep disappointment they found no change whatever. There was the
      same calm, the same unruffled sea, the same cloudless sky. Not a sail was
      visible anywhere, and of course there was no sign of land on any quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day the time hung more heavily on their hands. Some of them
      proposed fishing; but they had no hooks, and moreover no bait. Pat
      proposed fashioning a spike into a hook; fastening it on a line, and
      fishing for sharks, and worked all day at a rusty spike for this purpose.
      Unfortunately, he could not get it sharp enough, and so he had at length
      to give it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet was perhaps the most impatient of all; and this seemed
      singular to the boys, who thus far had known him only as the most patient
      and the most enduring of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, however, his patience seemed to have departed. He
      fidgeted about incessantly. He kept watching the sea, the sky, and the
      horizon, and occupied himself for hours in all the various ways common
      among seamen, who indulge in the superstitious practice of trying to
      &ldquo;raise the wind.&rdquo; One mode consisted in standing in one position
      motionless for half an hour or more, watching the horizon, and whistling:
      another was a peculiar snapping of the fingers; another was the | burning
      of some hairs pulled from his own venerable head. These and other similar
      acts excited intense interest among the boys, and helped to make the time
      pass less slowly. Unfortunately, not one of these laudable efforts was
      successful, and the obstinate wind refused to be &ldquo;raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day the boys detected something in their meals which seemed like a
      decline of skill on the part of Solomon. There was a falling off both in
      the quantity and in the quality of the eatables. Only four potatoes graced
      the festive board, and a piece of corned beef that was quite inadequate to
      their wants. The tea was weak, and there was very little sugar. There was
      only a small supply of butter, and this butter seemed rather unpleasantly
      dirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day all this was explained. Hurrying up on deck at early
      dawn, they saw the scene unchanged. Above was the cloudless sky, all
      around the glassy sea, and before them stood Captain Corbet, the picture
      of despair. By his side stood Solomon, with his hands clasped together,
      and his head hanging down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault, boys,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, with something like a
      groan. &ldquo;I was to blame: But I declare, I clean forgot. And yet what
      business had I to forget? my fustest and highest duty bein to remember.
      And here we air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom, who, like all the rest was struck by
      Captain Corbet&rsquo;s despairing attitude and words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hide it any longer, boys,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s this calm. I didn&rsquo;t
      calculate on bein becalmed. I thought only of head winds, and then we
      could hev put back easy; but a calm! Why, what can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hide it?&rdquo; Cried Bruce. &ldquo;Hide what? What do you mean by this? What would
      you want to put back for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For&mdash;for pro&mdash;provisions, dear boys,&rdquo; he said mournfully, and
      with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provisions!&rdquo; repeated Bruce, and looked very blank indeed. All the boys
      exchanged glanced, which were full of unutterable things. There was
      silence for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was the first to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have we?&rdquo; he, asked, in his usual cheery voice. &ldquo;Come captain,
      tell us what there is in the larder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Solomon,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Solomon, tell us the worst,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Solomon would not or could not speak. He raised his head, looked
      wildly around, and then hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet looked after him, and heaved a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the fact is, Solomon and me, we&rsquo;ve been talkin it
      all over. You see, he considers himself cook, and cook only, and looks to
      me for the material. It&rsquo;s all my fault. I forgot. I thought there was lots
      till yesterday mornin. Then Solomon told me how it was. I&rsquo;d ort to have
      laid in a supply before leavin Bay de Chaleur; but as I said, I forgot.
      And as for Solomon, why, he&rsquo;s been calmly a continooin of his cookery,
      same as if he was chief cook of a fust-class hotel, and all the time he
      was in a becalmed schewner. He told me all about it yesterday mornin; but
      I says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell the boys; mebbe the wind&rsquo;ll change, and I&rsquo;ll sail for
      the nighest port.&rsquo; So he didn&rsquo;t, except so far as you might have guessed,
      from the meals which he served up; pooty slim they were too; but he did
      his best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, with unaltered self-possession, &ldquo;it would have been
      better for us to have known this yesterday morning; but that can&rsquo;t be
      helped. So we have no more provisions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precious little,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we any?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;the tea&rsquo;s all gone; and the coffee, and all
      the potted meats, and the apples, and the taters, and the turnips and
      carrots, and all the vegetables, and the smoked provisions, and you had
      the last mite of corned beef yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is there left?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two or three papers of corn starch,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, with an
      effort, &ldquo;and, I believe, a half box of raisins, and a little rice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a hooter,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was silent. The boys all looked at one another with anxious faces, and
      then began to talk over the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was, that first of all they made Solomon produce everything in
      the shape of eatables that remained on board. Solomon ransacked the
      vessel, and laid everything out on the cabin table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a very large supply, and the display created additional
      uneasiness in the minds of the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      3 papers of corn starch, 1 lb. each.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 ham bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      l box raisins.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 lb. rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      6 biscuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 bowl soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 carrots.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 potato, turnip.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 oz. tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all&mdash;absolutely all on board the Antelope for the sustenance
      of no less than nine human beings, all of whom were blessed with excellent
      appetites. Fortunately, there was a sufficient supply of fresh water, so
      that there was no trouble on that score.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this supply of food, even when husbanded with the greatest care, could
      scarcely last more than one day,&mdash;and here they were in the middle of
      the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and becalmed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances in which they were, excited the deepest anxiety in the
      minds of all. A grave and earnest discussion followed as to the best
      course to be pursued. First of all, they all resolved to deny themselves
      as far as possible, and make their supply of provisions last three days.
      This could be done by making a very thin soup out of the ham bone with the
      potato and turnip. The raisins were to be cooked with the corn starch and
      rice, in one general mess, which was to be carefully divided day by day.
      The biscuits, carrots, and apples were to be reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they decided to try and construct something like oars, and
      propel the Antelope in that manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provisions were divided and cooked in accordance with this decision.
      They all went without breakfast, for they had decided to eat but one meal
      per day. At midday they partook of this important meal, which consumed one
      third of their whole stock. But little was afforded out of that one meal
      for each individual, and each one felt able to consume the whole repast,
      instead of the beggarly ninth part which fell to him. Poor Captain Corbet
      refused at first to eat, and so did Solomon, for each reproached himself
      as the cause of the present famine; but the boys put a stop to this by
      refusing also to eat, and thus compelled Solomon and the captain to take
      the allotted nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the oars or sweeps, the plan proved a total failure. There was
      nothing on board which could be used for that purpose. There was but one
      small oar for the boat, and they could find nothing else that could serve
      for an oar except the spars of the schooner, and they were not quite
      prepared to resort to these. Even if they had done so, there was not an
      axe or a hatchet on board with which to fashion them into the requisite
      shape. There was, in fact, no tool larger than a pocket knife, except
      perhaps the table knives, and they were too dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the first day of their famine passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to bed hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      They awaked famished, and found the calm still continuing. There was no
      breakfast for them. The long hours passed slowly. In vain Captain Corbet
      whistled for a wind. The wind came not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was served at midday. Each one ate his meagre share. Each one felt
      that this repast only tantalized his appetite, rather than satisfied it.
      Solomon was in despair. Captain Corbet heaped upon himself never-ending
      reproaches. Wade sat stolid and starving on the deck. The boys stared,
      with hungry eyes, around the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a sign of land; there was not a sail to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the second day passed away.

      third day came. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys slept soundly during the night, and were up early. As they took
      their first look all around, their feelings were those of deep
      despondency; for far and wide, as before, there was nothing visible but
      the smooth sea and the cloudless sky. The calm continued, and all the east
      was glowing with the fiery rays of the rising sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a cry from Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ship! A ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; asked all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; cried Phil, in intense excitement, pointing towards the
      east, where the fiery sky rose over the glowing water. Looking in the
      direction where he pointed, they all saw it plainly. It was indeed as he
      said. It was a ship, and it was now plainly visible, though at first, on
      account of the glare, none of them had noticed it but Phil. As they stood
      and looked at it, every one of them was filled with such deep emotions of
      joy and gratitude that not a word was said. Captain Corbet was the first
      to break the solemn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I declar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ben so dim all along that I didn&rsquo;t notice
      her; and then it kine o&rsquo; got so bright that the glare dazzled my eyes; but
      there she is, sure enough; and now all we&rsquo;ve got to do is to manage to get
      into communication with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys made no answer, but stood looking in silence. Every minute the
      glare lessened; then the sun rose, and as it ascended above the horizon,
      the form of the strange ship became fully revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a ship apparently of considerable size; but her hull was low down
      in the water, and only her masts were visible. She seemed to lie below the
      horizon, yet was as plain to the eye as though she had been only five
      miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, at length, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you feel, but for
      my part I feel like taking the boat and going off to her at once. I&rsquo;m sick
      of this fare, and should like to get a good breakfast. What do you think,
      captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly seem to see my way clear to approvin of
      you takin a row for such a matter as twenty mile or so. We&rsquo;d never see you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty miles!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce. &ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t look like more than
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you can&rsquo;t see more of her than her masts,&rdquo; replied Captain Corbet;
      &ldquo;and a ship that&rsquo;s down below the horizon far enough to hide her hull is a
      pooty good distance off&mdash;twenty mile, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Bruce was silent. Captain Corbet&rsquo;s remarks were unanswerable, and
      he did not yet feel prepared to row so great a distance as twenty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Bart went to the cabin, and returned with a spy-glass. This
      instrument did not belong to Captain Corbet, for the venerable navigator
      was strongly prejudiced against any such instruments, and the dimmer his
      eyes grew, the stronger grew those prejudices. It belonged, in fact, to
      Bruce, who had provided himself with it before leaving home. Armed with
      this, Bart took a long look at the stranger. Then he passed the glass to
      Bruce, and then all the boys, in turn, took a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange ship already appeared surprisingly distinct for a vessel that
      lay below the horizon; and on looking at her through the glass, this
      distinctness became more startling. Most of her sails were furled, or
      rather, there appeared to be no sails at all, except the jib. The fore and
      main-top gallant masts were gone. She appeared, indeed, to have
      encountered a storm, in which she had lost her spars, and the present calm
      seemed very little in accordance with her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comments which the boys made upon the appearance of the stranger
      excited Captain Corbet&rsquo;s curiosity to such a degree that he surmounted his
      prejudices, and condescended to look through the glass. His astonishment
      at the result was due rather to his own ignorance of glasses than to
      anything in the strange ship; but after he had become somewhat more
      familiar with the instrument, he began to pay attention to the object of
      his scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said he, after a long and careful search, &ldquo;it doos railly
      look jest for all the world as if that thar craft has been in a storm, and
      lost her spars and sails. Perhaps he&rsquo;s in distress. Perhaps they&rsquo;re
      watching us more anxiously than we&rsquo;re watching them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if they can see us?&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re so small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve got a glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;d be sweeping the horizon for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could get nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re hard up, they might row to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it any use to signalize, captain?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a mite,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t signalize to a vessel so far
      away; at least I never heard of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, captain,&rdquo; objected Bruce, &ldquo;you see they have glasses. We could
      see any signals if they were to hoist them, and they can see us as well as
      we can see them, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, thoughtfully, &ldquo;perhaps they can; and if so,
      I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see why we mayn&rsquo;t try. So you may as well hist that thar
      flag o&rsquo; yourn, boys. It can&rsquo;t do any harm, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposal was at once acted upon. Several of the boys sprang aft, and
      seizing the lines, began to lower and elevate, incessantly, the proud, yet
      somewhat battered banner of the B. O. W. C.&mdash;the banner whose
      pictured face had so often grinned at them through many an adventure, in
      storm and in calm. It gave them an occupation; it also served to excite
      hope; and so, for several hours, the flag never ceased to rise and fall,&mdash;the
      boys taking turns at it, and one relieving the other, so as to keep a
      fresh hand always at the work. This continued till midday; but at length
      they gave it up in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave it up because it had not produced the slightest result, nor
      excited the smallest attention; nor had the circumstances of their
      situation changed in any respect whatever. Far away lay the ship, and no
      more of her was visible. Nothing but her masts appeared to their eyes; not
      a particle of her hull could be seen. She seemed somewhat longer now, and
      some of them accounted for this on the ground that she had changed her
      position somewhat, and presented her broadside more than she had done in
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather had not changed, nor were there any signs whatever of a
      change. The sky was still as cloudless as ever, and not the faintest fleck
      disturbed the expanse of blue that hung above them. The sea was unruffled,
      nor was there any puff of wind to agitate its surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, when that strange ship first appeared, they had
      hoped that a wind might arise before long to bring them together; or, if a
      wind did not come, that at least the currents of the sea might drift them
      into closer proximity; but now there began to arise a dark fear that,
      instead of drifting nearer together, they might be carried farther
      asunder, and that this strange ship, which had thus been borne so
      mysteriously to their sight during the darkness, might, on the advent of
      another day, be borne as mysteriously out of their sight. With anxious
      eyes they watched her form, testing it in every possible way, to discover
      whether the intervening space had increased or lessened. Some of the more
      desponding ones were convinced that they were drifting asunder; others,
      more hopeful, maintained that they were nearer; while others, again,
      asserted that their respective positions had not changed. And, in fact, it
      was evident from the very dispute itself, that the position of the two
      vessels had not very greatly altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of the day had passed. Another half remained; and after that, what?
      Night and darkness, and then how easily could they drift away from this
      stranger, on which they had been placing such hopes! How could they expect
      that the rest of the day would be any different from the beginning?
    </p>
    <p>
      Midday had come, and this was the time for their single daily meal.
      Moreover, this meal was the last,&mdash;the last of the three portions
      which they had set aside for the consumption of three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here arose a solemn question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should they eat up all of this last portion? or should they divide it into
      two parts, reserving something for the possible emergency of the next day?
      The moment that this was proposed, they all decided at once to reserve
      something, and not to devour at once all that was left. They determined to
      deny themselves for this day for the security of the morrow; and, hungry
      though they were, they preferred to have a meagre repast with hope, rather
      than a fuller repast with despair. And so their dinner was divided, and
      one portion set aside for the next day. Meagre indeed and inadequate was
      this repast for these long-fasting and ravenous boys; but there was no
      help for it; and as yet they had not quite reached the worst. They,
      therefore, all tried most strenuously to look on the bright side, make the
      best of their situation, and cheer one another with remarks of a hopeful
      and encouraging character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was prolonged as far as possible. Then came the long hours of the
      afternoon. Gradually the efforts of the boys to keep up their own spirits
      and encourage one another grew feebler and feebler. From time to time they
      made faint efforts to find occupation for themselves, by resorting to the
      flag, and actively lowering and hoisting it. But the greater part of the
      time was spent in silently and sadly staring at the strange ship,
      sometimes through the glass, whenever they could get the chance, but
      generally without it. The remarks grew more and more infrequent. The
      hoplessness of their situation began to weigh down more and more the
      spirits of each, and at length they, one and all, relapsed into silence.
      Solomon kept out of sight. Wade sat, as usual, stolid and passive. Captain
      Corbet stood at the helm, looking in all directions, at sea and sky, with
      an unchanged expression of heart-broken melancholy. So the time passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was far worse than the morning: in every respect. The moral
      tone of the whole party had declined, and the whole scene around presented
      no encouraging feature. In the morning they had been inspired by the hope
      of making communications with the ship, but now this hope died out more
      and more with every passing moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the sun went down, and then the shadows of the gloomy night
      followed slowly and steadily. One by one the shades passed over the
      distant ship, until at last they stood staring at the place where they had
      seen her, but where now they could see nothing but darkness. This
      completed their despondency, and the gloom around was commensurate with
      that which now fell darkly and desparingly over the soul of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time they wandered up and down the deck. No one spoke. Each one
      was involved in his own gloomy thoughts. At length, one by one, they
      retired to their beds, with the hope of forgetting their cares in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce and Bart were left on the deck alone. All the rest had gone below.
      Around all was dark. Both the boys were pacing up and down restlessly on
      opposite sides of the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Bruce stopped. &ldquo;Bart,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, &ldquo;is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Look here. I&rsquo;ve got something I want to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Bart came up to him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this style of thing,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what can we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, never mind. I&rsquo;ve got a plan. Do you think we couldn&rsquo;t have been doing
      better all this day than staying here, moping our lives out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean the very thing that I proposed this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, to row to the ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you row twenty miles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense. She can&rsquo;t be so far. Captain Corbet&rsquo;s utterly
      mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s below the horizon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I judge from the looks of her. Do you believe you can see
      so plainly a ship that&rsquo;s twenty miles away? Why, man alive, if she had a
      flag up you could almost make it out. For my part, I feel sure that she
      isn&rsquo;t over five miles away at the very farthest. I haven&rsquo;t the slightest
      doubt about it. Why, Bart, you and I are both accustomed enough to look at
      ships out on the water, and you can see for yourself that it&rsquo;s simply
      impossible that this one can be so far away as twenty miles, or farther
      away than I say. All the morning I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling puzzled, and
      concluded that it might be something in the atmosphere that magnified the
      ship, and made her seem so near,&mdash;like the mirage, you know; but,
      afterwards, I gave that up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, after some thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what you&rsquo;re about
      right, Bruce; but what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got this night before us, and if the wind comes, why, of
      course we are all right. But suppose that the wind doesn&rsquo;t come, and we
      find ourselves to-morrow morning as we did this morning, with that ship so
      near. Do you feel able to stand here all day, and watch, and wait, and
      then sit down to our last dinner? I don&rsquo;t. Or suppose that we find
      ourselves gradually drifting away from her. No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it.
      I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to row out to her. What do you say? Will you come
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Bart, firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, even if it is twenty miles. I&rsquo;d go
      forty, rather than live this day over again. But when do you propose to
      start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it all over,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;My plan is this: We&rsquo;ll get
      all ready to-night; that is, have the oars in the boat, and put in a
      couple of bottles of fresh water; besides, we can take with us about our
      share of the food that remains. Well, to-morrow morning, if the calm
      continues, the moment that we see the ship, we&rsquo;ll start, and row for her.
      Why, if we had only done that this morning, by this time we&rsquo;d have been on
      board of her, with a boat from the ship back here with provisions. Mind
      you, don&rsquo;t think of twenty miles; it isn&rsquo;t more than five at the very
      furthest&mdash;perhaps not over three or four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll go. Do you intend to tell anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not a soul. The rest of the fellows would insist on going; and it
      will be better for us two only to go; it will prevent confusion, and be
      the best for all concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can we get away without their knowing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, my idea is to push off from the schooner before any one is up, and
      then watch for the appearance of the ship by daylight. The moment we see
      her we can pull for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems pretty good,&rdquo; said Bart, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but it is a puzzle to
      me how that ship can be below the horizon, and yet not be farther off than
      five miles. She certainly did not look farther away than that. For my
      part, I don&rsquo;t see how she could be less than ten miles at the least, so as
      to be so completely hidden. I forget the rule for the disappearance of a
      ship below the horizon; but there is something in this one that I can&rsquo;t
      understand. Yet, as you say, judging by the appearance of her masts, one
      might imagine her to be not more than three or four miles off. After all,
      it must be mirage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no; mirage doesn&rsquo;t last all day long, without the slightest change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know. It may in this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand all the freaks of the
      atmosphere; but all that I&rsquo;ve ever read about the mirage shows that it is
      incessantly shifting and changing, and never lasts over an hour or so, at
      the furthest. Besides, in our latitudes, these peculiar appearances only
      take place in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;At any rate, I shall be prepared for a
      row of at least ten miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Make up your mind to that, and then you won&rsquo;t be
      disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you go to bed to-night, Bruce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you wake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I can wake whenever I like. I&rsquo;ll wake you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. About what time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, about an hour before daybreak; but come, let&rsquo;s get things ready now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys then went about completing their preparations for their
      adventurous journey. These were but slight. They consisted in simply
      putting on board the boat, which was floating astern, two bottles of fresh
      water and a little of the provision which had been put aside for the next
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they both retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, at about three o&rsquo;clock? Bruce laid his hand on
      Bart&rsquo;s forehead. Bart awoke instantly. The two then went as softly as
      possible on deck. No one was there. All were below, sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently, yet quickly, the two boys got into the boat, and then pushed
      off. There were two oars in the boat. Each took one, and then began to
      row. But, after a few strokes, Bruce took the oar from Bart, for the boat
      was too small for two oarsmen. So Bruce pulled very silently out into the
      darkness over the water, in the direction which they supposed would lead
      towards the strange ship. After rowing about a hundred yards Bruce
      stopped. Both boys now waited patiently till it should become light enough
      for them to see the ship.

      the break of day the boys were all on deck. Their first impulse was to
      take a look around. They saw the reddening eastern sky and the smooth
      water all around them, and their hearts sank within them as they perceived
      that the wearisome calm still continued. They noticed, however, that the
      ship was still visible, and this was some consolation. It seemed now a
      little nearer than the day before. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got nearer to her: don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain made no reply. Tom looked up, and repeated his remark. As he
      looked up, he saw Captain Corbet standing astern with a puzzled
      expression, and looking down into the water and all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s been and stole her, or else she&rsquo;s gone to the bottom, only the
      rope&rsquo;s gone, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! the boat!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say the boat&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boys were startled at this, and hurried aft to look for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t in her this time, at any rate,&rdquo; said Tom, and then
      added in a melancholy voice, &ldquo;but I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t make much
      difference now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys stood in silence for some time, not quite knowing how to take
      this new incident. At length Phil looked all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bart?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and Bruce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not up,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wake them. Let them sleep as long as
      they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up? They&rsquo;re not down, either,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;Their berths are empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys all stared at each other. A suspicion flashed across their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure and if they&rsquo;re not up nor down, they must be in the boat, and there
      you have it,&rdquo; said Pat, dryly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s meself,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that &rsquo;ud
      be proud to be with thim this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat? But what for?&rdquo; asked Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have started off for the ship,&rdquo; said Tom, who-now understood
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this they all looked with eager eyes over the water in the direction of
      the ship. All thought that they could see a shadowy spot, but it was too
      indistinct as yet to be resolved into anything. After a few minutes Phil
      went below, and returned with the glass, through which he looked long and
      attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them,&rdquo; said he at last, passing the glass to Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked, and then Tom, and then Pat, and then Captain Corbet. It
      grew brighter and brighter every moment, and at length, as Corbet looked,
      he saw the boat plainly for an instant; but the next moment the glare of
      the rising sun drove his eyes away. The sun rose and ascended higher, and
      still they could see the boys rowing with quick strokes very far away,
      while beyond lay the strange ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still as low down as ever, &ldquo;below the horizon,&rdquo; as Captain Corbet
      said, but was very much larger and plainer. Every one of them wondered how
      she could be in reality so far away as twenty miles. None of them spoke,
      however, but stood with varying feelings, staring in silence after their
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of them all the most affected was Captain Corbet. At the first mention of
      the fact he had started, and after having assured himself of its truth
      with his own eyes, he exhibited every mark of the deepest agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, as he stood with his head bowed upon his breast. &ldquo;I never!
      Who&rsquo;d a thought it! Why, its ravin madness. And them, too, thinkin of
      rowin to a ship that&rsquo;s below the horizon. Twenty mile in that thar boat,
      if it&rsquo;s an inch, and two mile an hour&rsquo;s the most they can do. Why, it&rsquo;s
      temptin fate. It&rsquo;s flyin in the face of Providence. That&rsquo;s what it is.
      That thar ship&rsquo;s twenty mile away. The wind&rsquo;ll come up before they get
      half way. They&rsquo;ll never get there&mdash;never. And stealin off in this
      way, too! Why didn&rsquo;t they get me to go with them? Why didn&rsquo;t they ask my
      advice? And them, too, a trustin of their two perecious lives in that thar
      ferrail bark, that hadn&rsquo;t ought ever to go more&rsquo;n a mile at the furthest.
      And here am I, chained to this post, and can&rsquo;t move, and them a rushin on
      to utter ruination. O, boys, dear boys,&rdquo; he concluded, in a kind of wail,
      &ldquo;for your sakes I want the wind to rise, but for their sakes I want it to
      contennew a calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, captain, never fear,&rdquo; said Arthur, cheerfully. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take care of
      themselves easy enough; and, in fact, the more I think of it, the better
      it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish I was in the boat,&rdquo; said Tom, heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure and that same I said meself at the first,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Solomon had stood a little apart from the rest, looking after
      the boat, but manifesting very different emotions. His occupation being
      gone, he had come upon deck to see what the prospects might be, and had
      heard everything. Taking advantage of a moment when the glass was not in
      requisition, he had given a look towards the receding boat, and had
      assured himself by actual inspection of the facts of the case. The moment
      that he had done this he drew a long breath, laid down the glass, and then
      stood looking after the boys with a gentle smile irradiating his ebony
      face. From time to time he would close his eyes, sigh gently, and his lips
      would move as though whispering to himself, while once or twice a half
      audible chuckle escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what it is,&rdquo; said he at length; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go on. Dem yer boys
      is goin to save der blessed selves and us too. It&rsquo;s my pinion dey&rsquo;ll bring
      us luck, fust rate, too, fust chop, tip-top, prime. Hooray! Dey&rsquo;ll quaint
      dem yar seamen ob our difficulties, an dey&rsquo;ll come back a flyin wid a big
      boat-load of pro-visium. O, you can&rsquo;t drown dem blessed chilen. Dey&rsquo;re
      boun to tak car ob demselves, and dey&rsquo;ll work dar way ober de oceum foam,
      to sabe de libes ob all aboard, and&rsquo;ll be back to-night to tea. Hooray!
      Mind, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gayety and hopefulness of Solomon did not fail to be communicated to
      all the rest, until at length even Captain Corbet was willing to admit
      that it was just as well, after all, that they had gone, though he still
      professed to feel hurt that his advice had not been asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the boys their situation seemed now in every way more endurable. They
      had at least something to hope for, and the adventure of their companions
      formed a perpetual subject for thought or conversation. Even the calm was
      now welcome, for as long as this continued it would be favorable to the
      boat. On the other hand, should the &lsquo;wind arise, they could up sail and
      after them. They all thought that Captain Corbet&rsquo;s estimate of a distance
      of twenty miles was extravagant; and even if the ship was &ldquo;below the
      horizon,&rdquo; they concluded that at the farthest it could not be more than
      eight or ten miles away. Allowing two miles an hour for the boat, they
      thought that Bruce and Bart might reach their destination by nine or ten
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and thus have the greater part of the day still
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hours passed away, the boys thus beguiled the time by various
      speculations about the progress of their companions. The calm continued;
      and they were not sorry, for they saw in this the best chance for a
      successful issue to the enterprise. Phil made a sort of chart, with the
      schooner and the ship in proper position, and marked off ten intervals
      which he estimated at a mile each. For hour after hour they watched this,
      and amused themselves by indicating on it the progress of their friends.
      At length it was ten o&rsquo;clock, and all the boys felt quite sure that the
      boat had reached the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the two adventurous boys had been going on their expedition. At
      a hundred yards from the schooner they had stopped, as we have seen, and
      looked anxiously around in the direction where they supposed the stranger
      to lie. For some time they could see nothing; but at length, as it grew
      lighter, they detected her masts through the gloom, and were overjoyed at
      finding that she was nearer than on the previous day. They had made a
      mistake, however, as to the right direction, for the ship lay very much
      more to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve drifted nearer together during the night,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
      believe she&rsquo;s over three miles away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he changed the boat&rsquo;s course, and heading for the ship,
      pulled with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Bruce,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better not pull so hard at first; you&rsquo;ll
      tire yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s only till we get further from the schooner. I want to get well
      out of the reach of hearing before the fellows see us. I&rsquo;ll take it easy
      after a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he pulled on, watching the schooner, and succeeded in getting
      so far away, that by the time they came on deck he could only distinguish
      the moving figures. Then he slackened his efforts somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a bit of prospect of any wind,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I tell you what it
      is, my boy: I&rsquo;d far rather be here this minute than aboard the Antelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;but can you imagine the state of mind that the
      fellows must be in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they&rsquo;ll be glad after the first excitement&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if they saw us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t shout, or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were too far off to hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we weren&rsquo;t; but I suppose we were so far off that they thought it
      would do no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For about half an hour Bruce pulled quite leisurely, for he wished to
      husband his strength as much as possible, and then Bart took his turn at
      the oars. Not much was said, partly because the exertion of rowing did not
      allow of any prolonged conversation, and partly because they were too much
      filled with their own thoughts, arising out of the suspense of the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after rowing for another half hour, Bart handed the oars to
      Bruce, and took his seat in the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he did so he uttered a cry of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how near we&rsquo;re getting!&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t looked since I took the oars, on purpose to see what our
      progress is. And now&mdash;why, really, Bruce, it seems as if we must be
      half way already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we are,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;and more too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s as low in the water as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; there&rsquo;s something queer about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks as though she&rsquo;d been in a heavy gale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a soul on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any one, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps no one is up yet. It&rsquo;s early, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart was silent for a few moments. At length he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see some signs of life there, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll know all about her by the time you&rsquo;re through your next
      pull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bruce now rowed, and Bart sat with his eyes fixed on the ship. She still
      lay as low in the water as ever, but they could see her bulwarks plainly,
      and her cabins. Her rigging seemed as disordered as ever, and it was a
      puzzle to Bart, why, in this calm weather, she should be so neglected.
      Various unpleasant thoughts arose in his mind, but he kept-them to
      himself. Thus the time passed, and Bruce rowed, and the boat drew steadily
      nearer. At length he gave the oars over to Bart, and took his seat in the
      stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were not more than a mile from the ship. She was
      certainly very low in the water. At a distance they had supposed that her
      sails were furled. They could now see that she had no sails at all. There
      was her jib, and that was all. There was no sign of life aboard, and the
      disorder in her rigging was more perceptible than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bart,&rdquo; said Bruce in a solemn tone, after he had gazed silently at the
      ship for full ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I think about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion that there&rsquo;s not a soul on board of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s evidently been in a storm; her sails are gone; her rigging is every
      way. The crew have probably deserted her; and, yes, she is&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no doubt about it. I suspected it&mdash;I knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterlogged!&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart turned his head and looked at her for a long time. He said not a
      word. At last he turned to Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at any rate, we must board her. After coming so far, we
      can&rsquo;t go back. Besides, we may find something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find something? Of course we shall,&rdquo; said Bruce, confidently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find
      lots of things. We&rsquo;ll find barrels of pork, and beef, and bread, and other
      things besides, no doubt. When they left her, they would only take enough
      to last them till they got ashore. They must have left the greater part of
      their supplies and sea stores behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;so here goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he pulled as vigorously as though he had not yet
      rowed a stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now every minute they drew nearer and nearer. Bart rowed without
      turning his head, but Bruce sat with his eyes fixed upon her, occasionally
      telling Bart when he got out of his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drew nearer in this way, every doubt was removed, if there had
      been any doubts in the mind of either. The ship was evidently deserted.
      She was also as evidently waterlogged. Now they were able to account for
      what had puzzled them before; her lying so low in the water, and yet at
      the same time seeming so near. Her nearness was not apparent, but real;
      her lowness in the water actual, and not seeming. That she had been
      deserted by her crew was more and more evident every moment, for as they
      drew nearer, they could see not a sign of life. Had there been any one on
      board, he would certainly have made himself visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Bruce bawled out, &ldquo;Ship, ahoy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart stopped rowing and looked around. Both boys listened. They did not
      expect any answer, nor did any answer come. They waited for about a
      minute, and then Bart rowed on. In about two minutes they were alongside.
      The oars were thrown in, the boat secured, and the two boys stepped
      aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0083.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      There was a mixture of attraction and repulsion in the first sight of the
      ship, which affected the boys very peculiarly. She lay waterlogged. Her
      decks were on a level with the sea. But her bulwarks rose six feet high
      above the water, and the deck itself afforded a spacious area on which to
      walk. The deck was white with the washing of many waters, and dry in the
      warm sun, which had shone upon it for some days past. All the boats were
      gone except one, which hung at the starboard davits, and looked like the
      captain&rsquo;s gig. The cook&rsquo;s galley stood amidships, and astern there was a
      quarter-deck. The cabin doors were open wide. The forecastle was also
      open. The main hatchway was open, and the boys, looking in, could see the
      cargo. It consisted of enormous pine logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of this cargo explained all. This was a timber ship, no doubt,
      from Quebec, which had encountered a storm in the gulf, and sprung aleak.
      On becoming waterlogged, she had been deserted and left to her fate; yet
      her cargo, which was of wood, prevented her from sinking, and the huge
      sticks of timber served to give her stiffness as well as buoyancy, and
      preserve her from breaking up. To Bart a timber ship was the most familiar
      thing in the world, for he had been brought up in a timber port; his
      father sailed timber ships, and the whole situation was one which he
      perfectly understood at the very first glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys walked about the decks. To their delight, they saw several water
      casks lashed behind the mainmast, and a row of barrels that looked as if
      they contained provisions, for they all bore the eloquent inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      MESS PORK.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Going into the cook&rsquo;s galley, they saw the cooking-stove in good working
      order, and the inmost thought and spontaneous expression of each was,&mdash;&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
      Solomon rejoice when he sees this!&rdquo; They then went aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a passage-way about three feet wide. On each side there was a
      door which was open. Looking in, they saw on one side a room full of
      ropes, and sails, and oakum, while on the other was another room full of
      ship&rsquo;s stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing on, they reached the cabin itself. It was a room about twelve feet
      wide and sixteen feet long. A door at one end opened into another cabin
      aft. On the sides of both cabins were doors opening into state-rooms. Two
      of these were very well furnished, and in the after cabin there was a
      large and comfortable state-room, which both the boys decided to have been
      the captain&rsquo;s. The furniture was all confused. The carpet was damp. It
      seemed as though the sea had been careering through these cabins and
      state-rooms. But the upper parts had been spared; and in the pantry where
      the boys at length found themselves, they saw, with a pleasure that cannot
      be described, the contents of the upper shelves as dry as when they were
      first put there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this they rejoiced more than at anything else.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE state of mind and
      body in which Bruce and Bart found themselves was of such a kind that the
      discovery of a well-stocked pantry and store-room gave them more delight
      than they had known for a very long time. They themselves were ravenously
      hungry; for the appetite which had been quickened by their long fast had
      been sharpened by exercise, and they also could not forget that their
      friends on board the Antelope were depending upon this expedition as much
      as themselves. Under such circumstances they looked around upon the well
      stocked shelves, and as, one after another, they recognized well-known and
      favorite articles of food, tears of joy started to their eyes. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea, and coffee, and sugar, and butter, and potted meats, and hams, and
      pickles, and many other delicacies of a similar kind, showed that their
      predecessors had not been indifferent to the pleasures of the table. In
      taking leave they seemed to have been very modest in their requirements,
      since they had taken away but little. As they continued their researches,
      they found other articles which increased their delight. There were a
      barrel of apples, boxes of raisins, drums of figs, bags of nuts, bottles
      of raspberry vinegar and of lemon sirup, a demijohn full of lime juice,
      and a delicious Cheshire cheese. Leaving the pantry and going into another
      store-room, they saw numerous barrels, some of which contained beef, and
      others pork. Opening another door, they looked in, and saw a chamber lined
      with tin and filled with pilot bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Bruce,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s postpone any further searches now, and
      get breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. What shall we have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I feel strongly inclined for some tea, broiled bacon, toasted
      biscuit, and Welsh rarebit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you add a few other things?&rdquo; said Bruce, with a laugh. &ldquo;How can
      we cook anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in the cook&rsquo;s galley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any fuel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a lot of coal in that front storeroom, and fagots of wood.
      Didn&rsquo;t you see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did, and I&rsquo;m going to make a fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any matches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you make the fire, and I&rsquo;ll set the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no; don&rsquo;t set the table here. Let&rsquo;s eat on the quarter-deck. It&rsquo;s
      rather close in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I&rsquo;ll gather the dishes and eatables.&rdquo; Bart now went about his
      task. Going into the store-room, he found the fuel, and carrying a supply
      to the cook&rsquo;s galley, he succeeded in a few minutes in producing a roaring
      fire. Then he filled the kettle, and before long the water began to boil.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time Bruce was ready with his part of the business. The teapot was
      brought forward, and the tea set to draw. Then a few slices of very
      superior ham were placed over the coals and broiled. While Bruce attended
      to this, Bart soaked some pilot biscuit in water till they were quite
      soft, after which he fried them in butter on the stove. He then proceeded
      to try his hand at a Welsh rarebit. He cut up some thin slices of cheese,
      added butter, and then allowed it all to liquefy over the fire. Having
      accomplished this, the two adventurers conveyed their things to the
      quarter-deck, and sat down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even had they been less hungry they would have enjoyed that breakfast.
      True, they had no milk in their tea, but they had long since grown
      accustomed, on board the Antelope, to dispense with that. The tea was of a
      very superior quality, the fried biscuit was most savory, the broiled ham
      was a great success, and the Welsh rarebit was pronounced delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already they had turned occasional glances over the water, and had seen
      the Antelope, lying apparently three or four miles away, in the same place
      where they had left her. Now, after they had satisfied their appetites,
      they began to look at her more closely, and to discuss the time of their
      return. They felt anxious to go back as soon as possible, but decided that
      they might as well postpone it until they were thoroughly rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident to the boys that the ship which they had boarded had been
      deserted very hastily, and they thought that her company must have boarded
      some other ship. In this way only could they account for the numerous
      things which had been left behind. Among these was a very good spy-glass.
      Bruce had seen this while preparing breakfast, and had brought it on deck
      with the other things. As they now sat on the deck after breakfast, they
      amused themselves for some time with looking at the Antelope. They could
      see several figures on the deck, but could not distinguish one from
      another. They tried to tell by watching their movements who each one might
      be. A solitary figure, that stood motionless at the stern, they were
      certain was Captain Corbet, while another figure, which indulged in rather
      eccentric movements, seemed to be Solomon. The rest could not be guessed
      at.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had already found out the name of the ship. They saw it in many
      places, on a row of buckets that hung in front of the cabin, on the
      captain&rsquo;s gig, on the cook&rsquo;s galley; they saw it engraved on a brass plate
      on the cabin door, on the capstan, and on the spy-glass; and this name,
      which they thus saw in so many places, was,&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      PETREL, LIVERPOOL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In discussing her fate, they concluded that she had loaded with timber at
      Quebec, had encountered a severe gale in the gulf and sprung a leak, and
      that another ship had hove in sight, to which the captain and crew of the
      Petrel had fled in their boats, without taking anything off their ship.
      They must have deserted her under the impression that she was going down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they accounted for the present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They decided to leave at eleven o&rsquo;clock for the Antelope, and return with
      the schooner as soon as possible. Nearly an hour still remained, and they
      thought it would be a good idea to prepare the Petrel for the reception of
      visitors, so as to afford as cheerful an impression as possible. This
      could be effected by making the cabin more &ldquo;shipshape.&rdquo; It seemed to have
      been entered by rolling seas, for the furniture was lying confusedly
      about, and there was some dampness in the air. The bedding also was all
      wet. They devoted themselves now to this. They opened the skylight, so as
      to secure ventilation, and the stern-ports. Then they brought all the
      bedding out, and spread it over the quarter-deck, where the hot sun and
      dry wind might do their work. Then they swept out the cabin, and arranged
      the furniture as neatly as possible. At the end of this a great change was
      produced, and the cabin of the Petrel assumed an appearance not only of
      comfort, but almost of comparative luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length eleven o&rsquo;clock came, and they began to prepare for their return
      to the Antelope. These preparations consisted simply in filling a bag with
      pilot bread, and putting this on board the boat; to which they added a
      ham, with some tea, sugar, and butter. They then embarked, and, pushing
      off, began to row.
    </p>
    <p>
      But scarcely had they rowed a dozen strokes when they became sensible of a
      breeze. It was a gentle breeze, and it was blowing against them. Bart, who
      was rowing, at once stopped, and Bruce at the same moment uttered a cry
      which made him look round. It was a joyous sight that they saw&mdash;a
      sight which assured them that they would be spared the long effort of
      pulling back again, for there, away over the water, they saw the Antelope
      spreading her white wings to catch the gentle breeze. If that breeze
      continued, it would bring her up to them in an hour, and though light, it
      promised to be steady enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s going to last,&rdquo; asked Bart thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it may be as well not to pull any farther just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. This breeze&rsquo;ll bring the Antelope here faster than we can
      row towards her, and we will not be gaining enough time to pay for our
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the wind might stop, and in that case it Would be a pity to lose the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it can&rsquo;t be of much consequence. If the wind does die away, we can
      start off. We can watch the Antelope all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re agreed, I am, I&rsquo;m sure; and besides,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I should like to do a little more to make the Petrel more
      presentable, and in better order for receiving our visitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that. Yes, that will be far
      better than wasting time in unnecessary rowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;is to set the table in the cabin, and cook a
      sumptuous breakfast to receive the starving Antelopers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Bruce, with enthusiasm; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cabin&rsquo;s a little damp, but not so bad as it was, and by the time they
      get here, it&rsquo;ll be dry enough. They won&rsquo;t be particular. We&rsquo;ll set the
      table regularly, bring out the best china, and cook some ham, trot out
      some of those potted meats, and have both tea and coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Welsh rarebit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, if we have time; but the fact is, I wasn&rsquo;t altogether
      satisfied with my last effort, and we can try it again some other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This new project was a most fascinating one to both the boys, who returned
      to the Petrel, and hauled up their boat on the other side, so that it
      could not be seen from the Antelope. This was merely to heighten the
      surprise which they intended to give. They then went to work to prepare
      the repast with which they wished to welcome their friends; and their only
      fear now was that the Antelope would reach them before they were ready.
      Fortunately, this was not the case. The breeze lasted, but it was light,
      and the progress of the Antelope, though steady, was slow, so that the two
      boys were able to complete their preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the time on board the Antelope had passed very slowly. The boys
      had felt full of hope about the result of the expedition of Bart and
      Bruce, but they were all ravenously hungry, and hope could not take the
      place of bread and butter. As the time passed they all felt more and more
      impatient, and after they had settled for themselves that the boat had
      reached the ship, they began to look for its return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from these thoughts they were all roused by a sudden cry of joy. It
      burst forth from Captain Corbet. Every one started and turned to see what
      had happened. They saw an exhilarating sight, which at once roused them
      from their gloom. There at the stern stood their venerable friend, a smile
      of exultation on his aged face, tears of joy in his mild eyes, one hand
      waving his hat in the air, and the other pointing over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s come! It&rsquo;s come! Hooray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was what he said, and as he said it the boys looked, and saw all over
      the water a gentle ripple. Then they knew it all. The long-wished-for wind
      had at last come, and they were freed from their long and irksome
      imprisonment. In an instant they all rushed to hoist the sails. As they
      hoisted them they felt the gentle air on their faces, and they saw the
      sails swelling at its touch. Soon all sail was hoisted, and Captain
      Corbet, with an exultant smile, stood once more at the helm, and the
      Antelope began to move through the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I knowed it all along, and I said it, I did. That
      thar wind was bound to come. I felt it in my bones; yea, down to my butes.
      I saw how down in the mouth you all felt, and didn&rsquo;t like to make you too
      san-goo-wine, but I knowed it, I did, I knowed it, all the same; and here,
      it has come at last, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The progress of the Antelope was slow, but it was progress, and that was
      enough. All the boys stood watching the ship, which they were gradually
      approaching. Solomon stood watching with the rest. Once he suggested the
      subject of dinner; but though before the wind came they had all been so
      hungry, they seemed now to have lost their appetites. The excitement of
      suspense was too strong, and none of them felt able to eat until they had
      reached the ship, and joined their friends again. And so they moved slowly
      over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon perceived that the ship was not half so far away as they had
      supposed, and then they discovered, not long after, the truth of her
      situation. They could see this better than Bart and Bruce had been able to
      do, for they had been sitting low down in a boat, while these were
      standing on the deck, or the taffrail of the schooner, and thus could make
      out the true character of the stranger more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came within sight, and learned this, they began to look eagerly
      about for signs of life. That the ship was waterlogged they could see, but
      whether there was any one aboard or not they could not see. What had
      become of the boat? Where were Bruce and Bart? They could see no signs of
      any boat whatever. But signs of life at length did appear in the shape of
      smoke from the cook&rsquo;s galley. Arthur, who was examining the ship through
      the glass, was the first to detect this, and it was not long before all
      the boys could see it with the naked eye. Smoke of itself would have
      indicated human life; but smoke from the cook&rsquo;s galley indicated something
      more, and was eloquently suggestive of those joys of the table to which
      they had too long been strangers. It served to assure them that their
      difficulties were approaching an end, and that smoke from the cook&rsquo;s
      galley was of itself enough to drive away the last vestige of despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the mean while, what had become of Bruce and Bart? That was the
      question which every one asked himself, without being able to answer.
      Where was the boat? They could not see it anywhere. Could the boys have
      gone on board the ship? They must have done so. The water had been too
      calm to admit of the probability of any evil happening to them. They must
      have boarded the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where were Bruce and Bart now?
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope drew steadily nearer, and all on board watched with
      indescribable eagerness the strange ship. Now they could see her
      disordered rigging, her yards bare of sails, her open hatchway. They could
      see bedding lying on the quarter-deck, and the open skylight. All these
      things indicated life on board; yet of that life there was no other sign.
      Where was the captain? Where were the crew? Where was the cook, who kept
      up such a roaring fire? It was all a puzzle. Above all. where were Bruce
      and Bart? Who could tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer and nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every moment brought them closer, but disclosed no living being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon crept up slowly to Arthur, and gently touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur started, and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Solomon! what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas&rsquo;r Atta, I donno bout dis yer craft,&rdquo; said Solomon, in a tremulous
      voice, with his eyes rolling wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Arthur, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donno; dar&rsquo;s somethin drefful curous bout dis yer craft,&mdash;beats all
      eber I see,&mdash;floatin under water; full ub water, an not sinkin; fire
      a burnin like de old boy in de cook&rsquo;s galley, an not a livin man aboard. I
      don&rsquo;t like it. Tell you what, now, I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Solomon. You&rsquo;ll take your
      turn in that cook&rsquo;s galley, perhaps, before sundown, and make acquaintance
      with the cook of the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon shuddered and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Captain Corbet, put both hands to his mouth, holding the tiller
      between his legs, and shouted, in a loud voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ship, ahoy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last!
    </p>
    <p>
      And what an answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the cabin bounded two well-known forms. They rushed out dancing,
      and capering, and flinging their hats in the air. They shouted, and
      yelled, and hurrahed. They ran up to the quarter-deck, and repeated these
      actions there. Those on board the Antelope were so astounded that they
      looked on in dumb bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haul up alongside!&rdquo; cried Bruce. &ldquo;Fetch her round! I&rsquo;m captain of this
      craft, and Bart is mate; I&rsquo;m steward, and he&rsquo;s cook; I&rsquo;m boatswain, and
      he&rsquo;s the crew. Hurrah! Haul up alongside, and heave us a line, my
      hearties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before Captain Corbet could recover sufficiently from his
      bewilderment to be capable of doing anything. Half mechanically he managed
      to bring the Antelope around, and man-. aged it just in time to cause her
      to move gently up alongside. Wade, who had all along been perfectly
      stolid, then proceeded to secure the schooner to the ship in the most
      matter-of-fact way in the world, just as if he had been securing her to
      the wharf in Grand Pré. But long before he had taken the first turn in the
      rope, the boys had bounded on board the Petrel, and proceeded to overwhelm
      Bruce and Bart with countless questions.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>RADUALLY they became acquainted with the
      whole truth of the situation. They had thought thus far that the ship,
      though waterlogged, was still in the possession of her captain and crew.
      Boundless was their astonishment at learning that it was in the possession
      of Bruce and Bart alone, and the astonishment which they experienced at
      this amazing discovery for a time drove away all other thoughts. But
      Nature at length asserted her supremacy, and the pangs of hunger, for some
      time past kept in abeyance, now awaked in full force. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you found anything to eat?&rdquo; asked Arthur, in a low voice,
      tremulous with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce did not reply, but looked at Bart. The other boys turned pale. For a
      moment the awful thought occurred that there was nothing; but the next
      instant there was wafted to their nostrils the savory odor of broiled ham,
      which overpowered that mournful thought, and drove it away effectually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;but that we may manage to scare up
      something. I suppose you&rsquo;re not very particular. Come in here, and I&rsquo;ll
      see what I can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he entered the cabin, and all the others followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one they entered the cabin, and one by one each, as he entered,
      stood rooted to the spot, and stared around in dumb amazement. Captain
      Corbet came last. He took one look, and then exclaimed, in a low,
      prolonged, and tremulous voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gerracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed there was every reason for surprise. They had come in expecting
      to enter the ruinous cabin of a half-wrecked ship, with perhaps a few
      mouldy ship&rsquo;s biscuit to be divided among the hungry company. Instead of
      this they saw a table set out to its fullest extent, with a white cloth
      spread, and on that table a repast which was nothing less than sumptuous.
      Tea, coffee, biscuit hard and toasted, Welsh rarebit, broiled ham, potted
      shrimps, game pie, pickled oysters, lobster, potted salmon, tomatoes,
      potatoes hot, steaming, and mealy, apples, raisins, nuts, figs, raspberry
      vinegar, lemon sirup, and numerous other dainties which Bart and Bruce had
      discovered and drawn forth from the rich store that lay accumulated in the
      pantry of the Petrel. The lavish abundance of everything, as well as the
      astonishing variety, overwhelmed the hungry new comers, and, except the
      exclamation of Captain Corbet, not one word was spoken. It was a moment
      when words were useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant or so Bruce and Bart enjoyed the astonishment of their
      friends, and watched the effect with a triumphant smile. They had been
      purposely lavish in this first entertainment of theirs, and had succeeded
      in placing upon the table a specimen of every individual article for food
      or drink which the ship contained. They had worked hard in anticipation of
      this moment, and now that it had come, they found it a complete success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Bruce, at last, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t eat with your eyes, you know.
      Come, noble captain, do you preside at this festive board. Tom, sit on the
      captain&rsquo;s right, Bart on his left. I&rsquo;ll take the foot of the table, with
      Phil on my right. Ward, my bold mate, sit next to Bart; Pat and Phil, fall
      in. Solomon, you go and install yourself in the cook&rsquo;s galley, where
      you&rsquo;ll find as much as you can eat for the rest of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this they all took their places, and began to eat with appetites such
      as those only can possess who have fasted for twenty-four hours on the
      sea. Bart and Bruce had already satisfied their own wants; so while their
      friends were eating they gave a full, complete, and exhaustive account of
      their own adventures, and their doings aboard of the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner passed off most delightfully, and a far longer time was spent
      at the table than the boys generally gave to their repast. Ample justice
      was done to the bountiful and varied supply that graced the board. After
      the first pangs of hunger were appeased, there were a thousand new
      questions to be asked and answered, in addition to those which they had
      already made. Captain Corbet alone said nothing. He sat and ate, and
      listened, and from time to time leaned back in his chair with a sigh of
      happiness, and surveyed the company with a smile that spoke of inward
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young ferriends,&rdquo; said the venerable captain, at length, taking
      advantage of an opening in the conversation to express his feelings, &ldquo;it
      is with feelings of no ordinary deskeription that I now address you. We
      have sailed over the briny and billowy main far and wide, and have
      encountered parls and dangers more&rsquo;n any ordinary people, but never have
      we been in such a position, or reduced to such extremities, as in these
      last few days. And now look at us. Here we air. What kind of an abode is
      this? Is it a ship? Scacely. Is it a island? Not quite. It&rsquo;s enchanted
      gerround! Here we air, an we&rsquo;ve been led by the kind hand of Providence to
      this secluded spot in the midst of the wide waste of waters. We come here
      in a state of starvation, with our minds in a kine of despair; we come
      here, and we found, as it were, a table spread for us in the wilderness.
      So far, so good; and I know, my dear young Christian ferriends, you all
      rejice with me, and feel as I do, full of gladness and gerratitood. But
      secondly, my dear ferriends,&rdquo; continued the captain, insensibly increasing
      his tone and manner to a sermonizing intensity, &ldquo;there air things about
      this here craft, that begin to occur to my mind, that go beyond the
      present fleetin moment, and interweave themselves with our footoor
      destiny. I ain&rsquo;t a goin to say jest now what these things air, but I want,
      fust and foremost, to browse round, and inspect, and cogitate, and
      meditate, till I kin hit on some kind of a plan for workin out what I
      want. I&rsquo;ll tell you when I get it all thought out, but for the present I
      am dumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this very mysterious conclusion, Captain Corbet rose and left the
      cabin. For the remainder of the day he kept by himself. He wandered all
      over the ship, and inspected every part most carefully. Then he retreated
      to the quarter-deck, and, seating himself there, lost himself in his own
      absorbing thoughts. What he was thinking about the boys did not know, nor
      did any of them inquire; for they were all far too much taken up with the
      novelty of the situation to pay any attention to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Solomon had followed the commands of Bruce, and had taken
      himself off to the cook&rsquo;s galley. There, two hours afterwards, on leaving
      the cabin, the boys found him. He had that expression on his face, and had
      installed himself in that particular attitude, which might have belonged
      to one who had lived and labored here for years. He had eaten a huge
      repast, and was meditating over a roaring fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah, Solomon,&rdquo; said Bart, who was the first to visit him. &ldquo;How goes
      it, my prince of darkies? This is a little ahead of the Antelope&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it? Now you can begin to live again; and I tell you what, you&rsquo;ll find
      enough stuff aft there to give us a first-rate bill of fare every day, and
      different every time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon jumped up with a grin..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is de dinna oba, Mas&rsquo;r Bart?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, den, I mus go aft an clar away de tings, and spect for myself, to
      see what we got roun us in dis yer craft. I been a tryin to cogitate an
      contrive for suppa, but I can&rsquo;t manage it nohow till I know zacly what I
      got to put my ole hands un. I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll take all de tings aboard de
      Antelope right away?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aboard the Antelope? Indeed, we don&rsquo;t intend to do anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what are you a goin to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Why, we&rsquo;ll stay here for ever so long. It&rsquo;s a kind of desert island,
      you know&mdash;only it&rsquo;s ten times better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the boys now came streaming forward, wandering all over the
      ship. Solomon went to the cabin, while Bart and Bruce proceeded to examine
      the mattresses. These were very much dryer than they had been, but still
      were so damp that several of them would require two or three days to
      become fit to sleep on. Others, however, were already nearly fit for use.
      Bart noticed that the wet ones came from the port side of the ship, and he
      remembered that the state-rooms on that side were much damper than those
      on the other. Water seemed to have penetrated there. He accounted for this
      on the supposition that this had been the leeward side in a gale, and,
      when the ship was filling, it had lain low down, and had received the
      washings of the waves. Fortunately, the storeroom and the pantry were on
      the other side, and thus their contents had escaped without injury. But
      the wet mattresses themselves were afterwards taken in hand by Solomon,
      who opened them, and dried their contents partly in front of the galley
      stove and partly in the open air. To assist in this process he kindled a
      roaring fire in the cabin, which served a double purpose, for it not only
      dried the mattresses but it also dried the cabin itself, and drove away
      the last vestige of dampness from the state-rooms on the port side.
    </p>
    <p>
      While busy in one of these, Bart saw a bottle lying on the floor. It was
      corked. On taking it up, he held it to the light to see what liquid might
      be inside. To his surprise he saw no liquid, but some folded paper. With a
      loud cry he rushed forth upon deck, displaying his bottle, and calling
      upon all the boys to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the eager boys had all collected around Bart, and even
      Captain Corbet was roused from his abstraction, and came to the centre of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one a corkscrew?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one in the pantry,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get it,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;break the bottle. You&rsquo;ll never get at the paper if you
      don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; said Bart; and the next instant he struck the bottle
      against an iron belaying-pin, and shivered it to atoms. The paper fell on
      the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart snatched it up, and opened it. It was a piece of coarse paper, that
      looked as though it had been hastily torn from some book. On it some
      writing was hurriedly scrawled with a pencil. It was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ship Petrel, of Liverpool, from Quebec, with timeber. Fog for two
      weeks, and violent gales. Lost reckoning. Took an observation last in lat.
      46° 5&rsquo; 22&rdquo;, long. 59° 8&rsquo; 2&rdquo;. Ship waterlogged, on beam-ends, and going to
      pieces. Taking to boats. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Hall, Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another scrawl that seemed intended for a date, but the boys
      could not make it out. It looked like &ldquo;Tuesday, March,&rdquo; but it might have
      been anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, was the writing. The captain had believed that the ship was
      actually going to pieces, and had hurried off evidently in the greatest
      possible haste, and had probably thrown into the boats a few of the barest
      necessaries of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bart suggested another theory. It was that the captain had put this
      writing in the bottle, and had got it all ready to throw over, when
      perhaps a sail had hove in sight, and thus the bottle had been left in the
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another theory was, that, in his hurry or panic, he had forgotten all
      about the bottle, which had floated about in the cabin, and been left in
      one of the state-rooms by the retreating waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident to all that the captain, &ldquo;Henry Hall,&rdquo; had lost his head.
      In his terror he had believed that the ship was &ldquo;going to pieces;&rdquo; whereas
      nothing of the sort was going on. She might possibly have been on her
      beam-ends, since he said so, but even here his fears might have
      exaggerated the danger. Captain Corbet thought that she had been struck
      over on her beam-ends, and held down by her sails, and, when these were
      torn away, she had eventually righted herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thar skipper,&rdquo; said he, sententiously, &ldquo;was frikened out of his
      seven senses, and fancied the craft was brakin up. So he rushed to the
      boats, chucked in a bag of biscuit and a few bottles of water, and rowed
      away for his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet paused for a moment, and looked at the boys with a very
      singular expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear young friends, do you know what you air and
      what you&rsquo;ve ben an gone an done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Bruce, in some surprise at the captain&rsquo;s tone and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, only this&mdash;you&rsquo;re salvors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salvors!&rdquo; repeated Bruce, to whom this word conveyed no meaning in
      particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salvors!&rdquo; repeated Captain Corbet, impressively. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve found this
      here ship on the broad bosom of the deep, deserted; you&rsquo;ve took possession&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;For that matter, she belongs to all of
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She belongs to all them that bear a hand to bring her into port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into port!&rdquo; cried Bart, in great surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, into port,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;That thar was the very fust idee
      that entered into my head as I sot foot on this here deck. This noble
      ship, this valable cargo,&mdash;is this to be given up, or surrendered to
      the tender mussies of the pitiless and ragin ocean? Not if I knows it. If
      we can manage to navigate this here craft into port, she&rsquo;s ours! We can
      sell her. We can sell her cargo. It&rsquo;s a val&rsquo;able cargo. It&rsquo;ll give each of
      us enough, if the proceeds air divided, to set us up for life. For my
      part, I&rsquo;m an old man, with one foot in the grave; but I never forget that
      I am a feyther, and never did the parential heart beat more wildly than it
      did at the identical moment when this thought came like fire into my
      brain. That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how in the world can we get her into port?&rdquo; cried Bart, in
      astonishment and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;that thar&rsquo;s the very identical pint that I&rsquo;ve
      been a cogitatin over the hull arternoon. I&rsquo;ve gone about this here craft
      on all sides, an I&rsquo;ve sot an surveyed her from a distance. I&rsquo;ve shot my
      eyes an meditated her all over. But thar&rsquo;s one grand and overpeowerin
      obstacle in the way to a fair navigation, and that is, she hasn&rsquo;t got a
      rag of a sail except that jib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So what can we do?&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get her to move an inch
      without sails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we rig up the sails of the Antelope?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet shook his head mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no how. Fust an foremost, the spread
      of canvas on the schewner ain&rsquo;t over an above sufficient to fetch her
      along, and on this here ship it wouldn&rsquo;t be a succumstance. Why, this here
      ship is a thousand tonner, an more too. Besides,&rdquo; added the venerable
      captain, with mild suggestiveness, &ldquo;the canvas of the Antelope <i>might</i>
      be stronger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a statement the truth of which was at once felt and acknowledged
      by all the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t no use doin things up in a hurry&mdash;not
      a mite. We&rsquo;ve got to deliberate, cogitate, turn it all over in our minds,
      and be precious keerful how we decide. There&rsquo;s a good deal at stake, and
      this here hour may be a goin to make or mar our fortins. I intend to brood
      over it this night, an p&rsquo;aps by mornin I&rsquo;ll see my way. The only trouble
      is,&rdquo; he added, in a pensive tone, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t quite know how I can ever
      see my way to navigatin this here vessel without sails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we can drift to some place,&rdquo; suggested Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet looked at Phil for a few moments with mild astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever tried driftin, young sir?&rdquo; he asked, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;except with you, in the Antelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, and in the Bay of Fundy. Now, if this was only the Bay of Fundy, I&rsquo;d
      feel at home. In that thar bay I&rsquo;d ventoor to cal&rsquo;late the exact point to
      which this here ship would drift. But this ain&rsquo;t the Bay of Fundy, and,
      what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t understand the currents of these here waters,&mdash;more&rsquo;s
      the pity, bein as I&rsquo;m a pilgerrim an a stranger. As to driftin, why, we&rsquo;ll
      drift, course, as long as we&rsquo;re aboard; but where we may drift to it would
      take a man with a head as long as a horse to tell. Why, we might drift to
      Portygal, and that, I think, wouldn&rsquo;t quite meet the voos of any of us.
      I&rsquo;ve knowed, or leastways I&rsquo;ve heerd tell of ships that&rsquo;s gone all the way
      over to Portygal, partly driftin, partly by the wind a blowin of &lsquo;em. But
      this here ship I want to indooce to go to some home port,&mdash;and how to
      do that is the puzzle that now occoopies this bewildered brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the captain gently passed away from the group of boys,
      leaving them to think over and to talk over this new and exciting project.
      It was in conversation about this and about the message in the bottle,
      that they occupied themselves till bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night they concluded to sleep in their old quarters on board the
      Antelope, as the beds and bedding in the cabin of the Petrel were not dry
      enough to satisfy the mind of Captain Corbet.

      in the Water-logged Ship.</i> <br /><br /><span class="pfirst"><span
      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was late on the
      following morning when they awoke. The effect of fatigue and excitement,
      together with perfect peace of mind, all conspired to make their sleep
      sound and refreshing. Solomon alone was up early; but it was nine o&rsquo;clock
      before they sat down to the sumptuous breakfast which he had prepared in
      the cabin of the Petrel. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon had found himself in command of a very well appointed larder, and
      he showed no inclination to spare it. He seemed to be endeavoring to make
      amends for his enforced idleness of the past few days by extraordinary
      activity and fruitfulness of invention in the culinary department. There
      was no lack of anything which the ship could supply; nay? there was even
      more than any of the boys had expected, for, to the amazement of all, they
      saw on the table before them several dishes of hot rolls; for Solomon had
      discovered among the ship&rsquo;s stores some barrels of flour, and had at once
      made a raid upon these. He laid before them coffee, tea, hot rolls,
      delicious fish-balls, broiled ham, stewed tomatoes, baked potatoes, with a
      variety of potted meats, prepared in manifold ways by his skilful hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast was a splendid success. It made all of them more delighted
      than ever with their situation. In fact, about that situation there was
      now an air of luxury; and the first determination of all of them was to
      move, bag and baggage, on board the Petrel, and live there. Solomon
      assured them that before the next evening all the bedding would be so dry
      that the most delicate invalid might sleep upon any one of the mattresses
      without fear. The boys, therefore, made their decision at once. They
      determined to take up their lodgings on board the Petrel, and proceeded to
      select state-rooms. As there was some difference in these apartments, they
      decided that the fairest way would be to draw lots. Captain Corbet
      positively refused to leave the Antelope, and so did Wade; so the boys had
      it all to themselves. Pat and Phil drew the best room (the captain&rsquo;s);
      Bart and Tom drew the next best, which was apparently the mate&rsquo;s; while
      Bruce and Arthur had the choice of any one out of the four remaining ones.
      All, however, were sufficiently comfortable to satisfy the most exacting,
      and none of the party had any cause to find fault with the result. Then
      followed the removal of their simple baggage, after which the boys began
      to &ldquo;fix up&rdquo; their respective state-rooms with as much care and labor as
      though they proposed spending the rest of the summer on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preparations did not take up much time; and before long they were
      all out on deck inspecting the bedding, and examining how far the various
      mattresses were prepared for being restored to their places. But it was
      decided to leave all these for the day, until Solomon should be ready to
      make the beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful day. The sky was without a cloud, blue and glorious.
      The sun shone down warmly and brilliantly. There was a gentle breeze,
      which tossed up the water into wavelets without making much motion, a
      breeze which was sufficient for the tranquil movement of some pleasure
      yacht, and not strong enough to excite any fear. There was a freshness in
      the atmosphere which was most exhilarating. The air was clear and
      transparent. Wide around lay the waste of waters, upon which not a single
      sail was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon cleared away the table, and then relapsed into the galley. The
      boys gathered into a little group upon the quarter-deck. To them thus
      assembled appeared the form of the venerable Corbet, a smile on his lips,
      a glance of benignity in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about this here salvage,&rdquo; he began, somewhat abruptly. &ldquo;You see,
      boys, I&rsquo;ve ben a thinkin an a dreamin, asleep an awake, all night long, an
      my pinion is more an more that we hadn&rsquo;t ort, none of us, to lose this
      present blessed chance, if we can possibly make anythin out of it. I&rsquo;ve
      ben a cal&rsquo;latin the valoo of this here ship an cargo. Now, this here ship
      must have cost at least fifteen thousand pounds. Of course she ain&rsquo;t wuth
      that much now, an I can&rsquo;t tell what she is wuth till I know what damage
      she&rsquo;s received. At any rate, she&rsquo;s wuth a good deal. As for her cargo,
      why, that&rsquo;s jest as good as the day it was put inside of her. Timber ain&rsquo;t
      like grain or cotton; it don&rsquo;t spile. Here, then, we have a couple of
      thousand tons or so of fust-rate white pine timber, wuth lots of money,
      and we have this ship, wuth thousands of pounds. Why, boys, at the
      smallest cal&rsquo;lation, the proceeds of the sale of this here ship and cargo
      would amount to over a thousand pounds apiece for every one of us,
      includin Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t myself I&rsquo;m a thinkin on,&rdquo; resumed the captain, after a
      pause, in a tone of mild melancholy, and with a pensive sigh; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      myself at all. I&rsquo;m old, sere, an yaller. I don&rsquo;t want money; I got enough
      for all my needs and pupposes. But it&rsquo;s the babby, dear boys, the babby.
      That thar infant is the true cause of my present wanderin life. He drives
      me to the ocean wave when I might be toastin my shins in front of my own
      stove. I want to airn somethin to leave to him when I&rsquo;m dead an gone. I
      got the house an the farm; but I want somethin more for the infant. All my
      cares are for him. I don&rsquo;t want to leave him to the cold world, to
      sturruggle an to sturrive. I want to give him a eddication, to make a man
      of him an a scholyer, a joy to his parient, and an honor to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now&rsquo;s the chance. Here we have it thrown into our very hands. We&rsquo;ve
      got it, an all we&rsquo;ve got to do is to make use of it. Here&rsquo;s this here ship
      an cargo. If we can only get her into some port, it&rsquo;ll be wuth over a
      thousand pounds apiece to every one of us, Solomon included. Each one of
      you boys&rsquo;ll have enough, dear knows, to keep you in pocket-money all your
      born days, or to buy you a fine schewner all to yourself. Solomon&rsquo;ll have
      enough to raise him far above the humble attitood of a ship&rsquo;s cook; an I
      will have enough to raise the babby above want, an rair him to be a
      gentleman an a scholyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Partly from the idea of getting plenty of pocket-money, partly to help old
      Solomon, partly to assist the respected Corbet in acquiring the means of
      giving an &ldquo;eddication&rdquo; to the &ldquo;babby,&rdquo; but more than all because they were
      moved by his earnestness, the boys universally chimed in with his wishes,
      and urged him most enthusiastically to do all that he could to save the
      ship. Captain Corbet listened with his usual mildness, and then suggested
      that perhaps there might be some sails stowed away on board; upon which he
      at once went off to search for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His search, however, was not successful. One sail was found, but it was
      quite inadequate to the needs of the ship. It really seemed to be, as the
      captain asserted, that the Petrel had encountered violent gales, in which
      her sails had been lost, and all her spare ones made use of only to be
      lost in turn. Certain it was that, though of other things there was no
      lack, of sails there was a total want; and the discovery of this reduced
      Captain Corbet once more to his former meditative mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Captain Corbet thus meditated, the boys talked over the situation.
      If sails were wanted, it seemed to them that the best thing that could be
      done would be for some one to go and get them. There was wind enough. The
      Magdalen Islands were not far away, and no doubt a sufficient supply could
      be obtained there. Some one might remain on board the Petrel. The question
      then arose, Who should go and who should stay? As to that there was no
      doubt. Every one of the boys determined to stick to the Petrel at all
      hazards, and thus Captain Corbet himself could go in the Antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with words to this effect that Bart broke in upon the musings of
      Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain listened to his remarks, and, though he was evidently struck
      by them, still there arose in his mind certain scruples, which under the
      circumstances were very natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no! no, no!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;railly, now, you mustn&rsquo;t try to persuade me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it would never do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Yes, it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to leave youns! Who could tell what might
      happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Are we babies? Can&rsquo;t we take care of ourselves? Of course we
      can! We&rsquo;ve been in far worse situations than this. Think of what we&rsquo;ve all
      gone through at different times! Think in particular of Tom and Phil, what
      they&rsquo;ve gone through! Are we the fellows that could meet with any harm if
      you were to leave us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you air; it&rsquo;s jest that,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all got a
      natral-born, innate talent for gettin into difficulties. You don&rsquo;t caitch
      me lettin you go out of my sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;See here, now, captain. There isn&rsquo;t and there
      can&rsquo;t be the slightest danger. It&rsquo;s all safe. We&rsquo;ll be as safe here as if
      we were on an island. This ship? can never sink. Why, I know all about
      these timber ships. My father owned one that got waterlogged just like
      this, in the middle of winter, in the Atlantic, and in the course of
      several tremendous gales she was blown over, to Europe. Mind you, she
      couldn&rsquo;t sink. She got into Liverpool, and was broken up there, and her
      cargo was sold for the benefit of the underwriters. Captain Beyea, who
      commanded her, told me all about it. Of course at this season of the year
      we&rsquo;re all right, for there&rsquo;s no likelihood of any storms; and besides,
      you&rsquo;ll only be gone a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet did not answer for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, boys,&rdquo; he said, at length, in a hesitating way, &ldquo;if you only could! If
      I only dar&rsquo;d!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we only could?&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Why, captain, you don&rsquo;t seem to know us!
      You think that we&rsquo;re a parcel of helpless children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that I may never have anything worse to do than
      to stay in a place like this&mdash;a floating palace, where we feed on the
      fat of the land. When I think of Ilee Haute, I consider this a sort of
      Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have known worse places,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;I could tell you of a
      burning forest, in comparison with which every other situation isn&rsquo;t worth
      being mentioned. Why, boys, this is going to be a sort of picnic&mdash;a
      pleasure party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;we are all settled here now. Each of us has his
      state-room. We&rsquo;ve got plenty of provisions. We&rsquo;ve made up our minds to
      spend a couple of weeks here at least. So you may as well knock under.
      While we&rsquo;re aboard, it will be much better for you to go off, and try to
      get some sails, than to wander up and down, moping, day after day, with
      the Antelope alongside doing nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an it&rsquo;s meself,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;that would be willing to sail off in
      the Antelope single-handed, if Captain Corbet is afraid, only I&rsquo;ll want
      one man to give a hand in navigatin, so I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, two could easily sail the Antelope,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall Solomon do?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;ll stay with us. What could we do without
      Solomon? We need him here more than anywhere else. Without him our life
      here would become flat and insipid. I could do the cooking once; but as a
      general thing, I should beg to be excused. Without Solomon we should not
      be able to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, meditatively. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s no trouble about
      me an Wade navigatin the Antelope. We don&rsquo;t want Solomon. He&rsquo;ll be best
      here with youns. If I could only leave you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s already settled,&rdquo; said Bart, decisively. &ldquo;You are going to
      leave us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;here we air, some-whar nigh onto fifty mile
      north of the Magdalen Islands. I steered doo north; an I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve
      made much of a muve since the calm began. Now, my idee is, that if we were
      to drop anchor here, this here craft would stay till I come back, an I
      know I could find her easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop anchor? Of course,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that. In fact,
      this was my only trouble&mdash;the possibility of drifting from this
      place. But if we were to drop anchor, why, of course it stands to reason
      that we shouldn&rsquo;t move from this place; and so, of course, you could find
      us again, as you say, without any difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her anchors air all right,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen em. There&rsquo;s
      sixty fathom of chain if there&rsquo;s an inch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come now. We&rsquo;d better drop anchor at once,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tempt me, boys,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, with evident emotion. &ldquo;You
      tempt me awful. I feel as though I hadn&rsquo;t ought to go; but you&rsquo;ve got a
      kind of a sort of a way of puttin things that makes it seem all so safe,
      an pleasant, an easy like that I&rsquo;ve half a mind to resk it, an go off at
      all hazards. For there&rsquo;s so much at stake! My babby! He pulls even now at
      my paternal heart-strings! His voice, even now, is a soundin in my aged
      ear! &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; he seems to say, &lsquo;go off, an hurry up with them thar
      sails.&rsquo; An then,&rdquo; continued the captain, after a pause, everything seems
      favorable. The breeze is fair; the sea is calm; the sky is blue; an I&rsquo;ll
      only be gone a couple of days at the farthest. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely
      there&rsquo;ll be another calm. The wind is fair for the Magdalen Islands.
      There&rsquo;s provisions enough aboard here for months: An, as you say, there
      railly ain&rsquo;t any danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, Bart. This here ship can never sink. Her timber
      cargo&rsquo;ll keep her afloat till dumesday, an, what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;ll hold her
      together. An I&rsquo;ve so much at stake! The babby! His fortune may now be
      made. It needs only one bold stroke, an all is done. Then we have the ship
      for our own, an the cargo, an we&rsquo;ll sell em both, an divide the proceeds.
      It&rsquo;ll be more&rsquo;n a thousand pounds apiece, an the babby&rsquo;ll be independent.
      He can receive a college eddication; he can grow up to be a gentleman an a
      scholyer; an he&rsquo;ll live to bless the memory of the aged parient who now
      doos violence to his own conscience for the sake of the footor interests
      of his offspring. Yes, yes, it must be done. An, boys, I rayther guess, on
      the whole, that p&rsquo;aps I&rsquo;d best go, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The decision of the captain thus announced was received with acclamation
      by the boys, and these marks of approval served to drive away the last
      vestige of hesitation from Captain Corbet&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;re goin to do it, we&rsquo;d best do it as soon as
      possible. So, fust an foremost, we&rsquo;d best let go the anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calling Wade, the captain then went forward, followed by all the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anchor was let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rattle, rattle, rattle went chain and windlass, and at length the anchor
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll hold, I guess,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re hard an fast. Now
      I&rsquo;ll know where to find you. You&rsquo;re no longer aboard a ship. You&rsquo;re on a
      fixed and immovable spot,&mdash;an island of the sea,&mdash;an here you&rsquo;ll
      stay patient and quiet till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These remarks the boys heard with the utmost placidity, and accepted them
      as absolute fact.. They had flung themselves headlong into this somewhat
      dangerous project, and were now more eager than ever for its successful
      completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After letting go the anchor, the next thing was to prepare the Antelope
      for her trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of provisions, boys, over there,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;as you
      may, perhaps, be aware, an we&rsquo;ll have to make a re-qui-sition on you. We
      don&rsquo;t want much; none o&rsquo; yer potted meats an chicken-fixins; none o&rsquo; yer
      luxoories an sweetmeats. All we want is a modest supply of good honest
      biscuit, with a little pork, a ham or two, an a pinch of sugar, an a
      drawin o&rsquo; tea. Wade an me, we don&rsquo;t go in for scientific cookery; we only
      want somethin to chaw at odd times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They now proceeded to transfer to the Antelope a sufficient supply of
      food. All the boys lent a hand. A dozen hams, a barrel of pork, a barrel
      of beef, and six barrels of ship bread were put on board the schooner, in
      spite of the remonstrances of the captain, who assured them that they only
      wanted a tenth part of all these stores. But the boys would not be balked
      in their hospitable intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the stores were all on board the Antelope, and nothing more
      remained to be done. The last moment had come. Captain Corbet was deeply
      affected, and seemed inclined to change his mind, after all, and stay. But
      the boys were eager in urging him off. So the good captain allowed himself
      to be persuaded against his better reason, and he and Wade got on board
      the Antelope, and the lines were cast off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sails of the schooner were hoisted, and the breeze filled them, moving
      the schooner slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet stood at the stern of the Antelope, holding the tiller. His
      face was turned towards the boys, who stood in a group on the quarter-deck
      of the Petrel. He seemed melancholy and miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;dear boys, take care of
      yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; cried Bart, cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope moved farther off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet stood looking at the ship, and his face had an expression
      of despair. At times he called out to them; but the Antelope moved farther
      and farther off every minute, and at length his voice could no longer be
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening when the Antelope left. In about an hour she was lost to
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were alone on the ship.

      the Antelope passed away from the eyes of the boys, and vanished into the
      shades of night. The breeze was light, and Corbet stood at the helm,
      shaping his course for the Magdalen Islands. The first feeling of
      uneasiness which he had experienced on leaving &lsquo;the boys in so very
      peculiar, perhaps dangerous, a situation, had passed away with the boys
      themselves, and his thoughts now turned on other things. He was virtually
      alone. Wade indeed, was on board, but the captain had sent him below to
      sleep, so that he might be able to relieve him and take his turn at
      midnight. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus alone at the helm, Captain Corbet looked out over the silent sea, and
      up into the starry sky, and lost himself in peaceful meditations. But his
      thoughts were not concerned with sea or sky. Other and dearer subjects
      gave them occupation. It was his &ldquo;babby&rdquo; that occupied his mind; that
      babby for whose sake he had deserted the boys, and left them alone in mid
      ocean. He was going to make a fortune for his son. He was going to take
      measures for securing the wrecked ship, so as to bring her into some port,
      sell her, and divide the proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night, and solitude, and silence are ever the best promoters of
      meditation, and Captain Corbet&rsquo;s fancy was stimulated and quickened by his
      present surroundings. In thought he went all over the Petrel. He examined
      her hull; he considered her cargo; he made light of her injuries&mdash;He
      concluded that a very small sum might make her once more seaworthy, and he
      thought that fifteen thousand pounds might be easily obtained for her.
      Then as to her cargo; that he knew must be perfectly free from injury. He
      tried to estimate the number of tons; then he multiplied these by the
      price per ton, so as to get at the value of the entire cargo. Then he
      added this to the value of the ship, and allowed his mind to play freely
      around the aggregate. It was a sum of dazzling proportions&mdash;a sum far
      greater than he had been able to make after the hard toil and persevering
      efforts of many laborious years! And all this he was now about to achieve
      by one stroke. It was to be the work of a few days. It was to be for the
      good of the &ldquo;babby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here another theme attracted the thoughts of the good captain,&mdash;the
      fondest of all themes,&mdash;his infant son. That son would now have
      something that would approximate to wealth. All his future would take tone
      and flavor from this adventure. The father&rsquo;s best feelings were roused,
      and in fancy he traced the future of his beloved infant. He saw him pass
      from long clothes into short clothes, from frocks into jackets, and from
      jackets into coats. He followed him in thought from his mother&rsquo;s arms to
      his own legs; from his home to the school; from the school to the college.
      He watched him consume the midnight oil for years, until he at length
      reached the brilliant end of his educational goal. Then he portrayed
      before his mind the form of his son in the future,&mdash;now at the bar
      pleading, or on the bench judging; now at the bedside of the sick; now in
      the pulpit preaching. He listened to the sermon of the imaginary preacher,
      and found himself moved to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; he murmured to himself; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idee the little feller&rsquo;d be
      so eliquint. It doos beat all, railly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet was really like one who had taken intoxicating liquor, or
      opium; and, in fact, he was intoxicated, but the stimulus was no drink or
      drug; it was merely his fancy, which had become heated by the extravagant
      dream of sudden wealth. Gold produces its own fevers and deliriums; and
      the good captain had been seized by one of these. Yet, after all, let it
      be remembered that his avarice was not for himself, but for his child. And
      as the lone navigator stood at his post under the midnight sky, in
      solitude and darkness, heaping up those bright fancies, out of which he
      was rearing so stupendous a castle in the air, he was building, all the
      while, not for himself, but for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he left the boys under any other circumstances,&mdash;that is,
      supposing that he had been capable of so leaving them,&mdash;there is no
      doubt that he would have been a prey to the most harassing anxiety on
      their account, and would have passed a wakeful night, full of mental
      distress. But now these new thoughts so occupied him that there was no
      place for anxiety, and he went on towards the accomplishment of his
      purpose as resolutely as though he had left them all in the safest and
      pleasantest place in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the situation in which they were left was one which might have created
      anxiety in the breast of even a more unfeeling man than Captain Corbet&mdash;on
      board a wrecked ship, that lay there in mid sea, with no means of saving
      themselves in the event of disaster. It was calm now, but how long would
      the calm continue? This breeze, that was wafting him along so gently and
      pleasantly, might stiffen, and strengthen, and intensify itself into a
      gale; and how would the gale act upon a ship that was virtually under
      water? Where could the boys betake themselves for refuge? How could they
      avoid the sweep of the surges that a rising storm would pour over her
      decks? Where could they find security from the downfall of the masts,
      which, in the writhing and twisting ship, must inevitably fall. A storm
      might change their foothold into a waste of boiling foam, and make the
      masts above as dangerous as the sea below. Even a moderate wind and a very
      ordinary rising of the sea might make their situation one of peril. Of
      this the boys, in their inexperience, had taken no thought; but this was
      the very thing that Captain Corbet ought to have thought of, and this was
      the thing that he was destined to think of afterwards with anguish of
      soul. But, for the present, not a thought of this sort came to him. His
      mind was altogether given up to the sway of those exciting and alluring
      fancies which beckoned him away to imaginary wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet had arranged to call Wade at midnight; but so excited was
      he by his dreams and speculations that he took no note of time, and was at
      length startled by the coming of the dawn. Then he hurried away, sent Wade
      to the helm, and flung himself into his berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long and profound sleep, which was the natural consequence of the
      excitement of the previous night, he awaked. To his surprise he found that
      it was about eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a hasty look around.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first feeling was one of satisfaction. There, immediately in front of
      him, were the Magdalen Islands. His course had been sufficiently accurate
      to bring him to his destination. He was near enough now to cast anchor,
      and Wade was already moving forward with that intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that first look that he had given he noticed another thing, for
      which he was not prepared, and which detracted somewhat from the
      satisfaction that had been caused by the sight of the islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a schooner at anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful outline, the slender, tapering masts, the white spars, and
      the immaculate neatness that characterized this schooner, all told him
      plainly what she was, and he needed no closer inspection to feel sure that
      it was the Fawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the sight of the Fawn disturbed the mind of the venerable captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreaded a meeting with her skipper, Captain Tobias Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Petrel was a prize for those who might be her salvors. To that
      fortunate situation he did not wish to admit any others. He wished merely
      to procure sails, and then navigate her somehow with the help that he
      already had. He knew well, and he dreaded, the keen inquisitiveness and
      the active, restless energy of Captain Tobias Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not want to meet with him at all. In fact, the very last person in
      all the world that he would have chosen to meet with at this particular
      time was this very man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great was his dread of a meeting, which might ruin all his plans, that
      his first impulse was to fly. He cast a hasty look all around. Upon the
      beach he saw the boat of the Fawn. Evidently the skipper was ashore. Upon
      this discovery he at once acted, and determined to move farther away.
      Hastily checking Wade, who was in the act of dropping the anchor, Captain
      Corbet wore round, and continued on his former course for a mile or so.
      Then, rounding the extremity of the island, he kept on his way along the
      shore, anxiously considering what was best to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other islands in the group, but this was the one which he
      wished to visit, for here only could he hope to find anything like sails.
      He had come here for this purpose, and to go away without accomplishing it
      was not to be thought of. It now seemed to him that the best thing for him
      to do, under the circumstances, would be to land here, and pursue his
      investigations in a quiet way about the island, managing so as to avoid
      all contact with Captain Ferguson. He therefore dropped anchor here, and,
      taking Wade with him, he went ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once on shore, he went about his search with the utmost diligence, going
      from house to house, and making inquiries about sails. But from the first
      his task was a roost discouraging one. Every one assured him that there
      were no spare sails on the island; all the schooners were away, and
      whatever stock any one had he generally kept in his schooner, and took it
      with him. This was the information that he got from every one to whom he
      applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hour after hour Captain Corbet kept up his fruitless search, dodging
      about cautiously, so as to avoid being seen by Captain Ferguson, in case
      he might be ashore, and keeping a wary lookout. At length he had visited
      every house on the island of any consequence. The only thing that they
      could suggest was for him to go to Miramichi, where he would be likely to
      obtain what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet, in deep dejection, now retraced his steps to the boat. He
      thought for a time of applying to Ferguson. But a moment&rsquo;s reflection made
      him give up that idea. He knew that Ferguson would be full of curiosity;
      that he would ask him all about the boys; and he feared that if he got the
      slightest hint of the facts of the case, he might start off instantly for
      the wreck, and thereby forestall him. It does not follow that Ferguson
      would really have done this; but this was Captain Corbet&rsquo;s belief, and it
      influenced him, of course, precisely as if the belief had been well
      founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus dismissed the idea of appealing to Ferguson, it remained for
      him to decide what next to do. He did not think of going back. Better to
      take Ferguson into his confidence at once. He still clung to his first
      hope and his first plan, and, since Miramichi was the nearest place where
      he could rely upon finding sails, he began to think about going there.
      True, this would take up two or three days more, and the boys would be
      left to themselves all that time; but, as he had already accustomed
      himself to think of them in their present position as quite safe, he was
      able to entertain the thought of leaving them this way still, longer. He
      had committed himself too deeply to his plan, he had gone too far towards
      its execution, and he had built too largely upon its successful
      accomplishment, to be willing to give it up just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so by the time he reached the boat he had about made up his mind to
      start off for Miramichi at once. With this resolve he went back to the
      schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment that he stepped on deck he was astonished at detecting in the
      atmosphere the smell of cigar smoke; and while he was yet standing, with
      open mouth and expanded nostrils, inhaling the unwelcome odor, he was
      still more unpleasantly surprised at seeing a figure emerge from the
      cabin, in whom at one glance he recognized the well-known and particularly
      dreaded lineaments of Captain Tobias Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      His unwelcome visitor held out his hand, and wrung that of Captain Corbet
      with affectionate cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect to see you back again in these parts so soon. You must have
      made a fine run of it, too. How far did you go? Not to the Bay of Islands&mdash;hey?
      Why, there&rsquo;s been a reg&rsquo;lar old-fashioned calm about here, and this here
      wind ain&rsquo;t much to speak of. And how are my young friends, the
      ragamuffins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;pooty tol&rsquo;able,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm&mdash;glad to hear it. And where was it, did you say, that you went
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;a&mdash;kine o&rsquo;&mdash;genral sort o&rsquo; kerrews, like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm&mdash;and so you left them in the Bay of Islands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;n&mdash;n&mdash;no&mdash;, &rsquo;twan&rsquo;t exactly thereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;not Anticosti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;n&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, with an increasing sense of
      discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, St. Pierre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;n&mdash;n&mdash;not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Paul&rsquo;s, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;&lsquo;twan&rsquo;t St. Paul&rsquo;s, nuther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, a kind o&rsquo; general cruise, I see; young adventurers, and all that. But
      I&rsquo;m glad you took my advice, and didn&rsquo;t go to Anticosti. A bad place. And
      how do they like Newfoundland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;they&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;quite git to Newfoundland, nuther,&rdquo;
       said Captain Corbet, in a low, faint, hesitating, confused way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; said Ferguson, briskly. &ldquo;Too far away; I said so. You
      concluded to go to Gaspe, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;n&mdash;n&mdash;n&mdash;no, we didn&rsquo;t quite get&mdash;off&mdash;in
      that thar&mdash;de&mdash;rection,&rdquo; replied Captain Corbet, who was utterly
      at a loss how to fight off this eager and inquisitive questioner. Had the
      good captain been capable of telling a lie, his task would have been
      easier; but he was a truthful man, and in this case he hardly knew what to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come now,&rdquo; said Ferguson, &ldquo;where did you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet started at this point blank question, and was perfectly
      dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson looked at him with keen scrutiny, and then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t answer. What&rsquo;s the matter? Has anything happened? Where are the
      boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the unfortunate Corbet was unable to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plain question enough,&rdquo; said Ferguson, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to
      answer it somehow&mdash;for I&rsquo;m going down Nova Scotia way, and may see
      some of their parents. So, own up, old man. What have you done with the
      boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a happy thought occurred to the bewildered Corbet. It came
      like a ray of light in deep darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you see, capting&mdash;you know&mdash;them thar
      youngsters, you know&mdash;they&mdash;they&rsquo;ve&mdash;got up a kine o&rsquo;
      secret society&mdash;you know&mdash;they told you&mdash;themselves&mdash;you
      know&mdash;and they&rsquo;re all together&mdash;you know&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a matter&mdash;of
      importance&mdash;to them&mdash;and to me&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to
      keep the secret, you know. O, I do assure you it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      all safe an sound&mdash;an enjyin life; good quarters, plenty to eat an
      drink, an ole Solomon a doin of the cookin&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a great secret,
      you know&mdash;and so&mdash;you see&mdash;capting&mdash;the fact is&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      a <i>leetle</i> rayther not let on where they air jest now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet spoke this in a confused way, and in a mild, deprecatory
      manner. Ferguson listened attentively to his words, and then stood looking
      at him for some time with an air of dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;old man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do remember some nonsense of theirs
      about a secret society; but you haven&rsquo;t answered my question; you evade
      it; and what their secret society has to do with their present situation I
      don&rsquo;t quite begin to make out. The fact is, I don&rsquo;t consider you a fit
      guardian for such boys as they are, and my opinion all along has been that
      they&rsquo;ll all get into mischief. I&rsquo;m afraid that they&rsquo;re in some fix at this
      particular moment, and that you have left them at the very time that you
      ought to be standin by them. If you don&rsquo;t choose to tell me, I can&rsquo;t make
      you&mdash;only I warn you, if the boys air in a fix it&rsquo;s best to let me
      know, for I can go and help them sooner and better than you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but railly, now&mdash;now&mdash;railly, capting,&rdquo; said Corbet, with
      great earnestness, &ldquo;I do assure you, honest and honor bright, there ain&rsquo;t
      no difficulty about the boys. They&rsquo;re all rail happy&mdash;tip-top, an no
      mistake; as lively as crickets; lots to eat an drink, comfortable beds,
      good cookery&mdash;all in good spirits and a enjyin of themselves in a way
      that would do your heart good to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;but where are they?&rdquo; persisted Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;now&mdash;railly&mdash;you know,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
      kine o&rsquo; secret&mdash;an I&rsquo;d very much rather not tell&mdash;that is&mdash;not
      <i>jest</i> now; now railly&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson looked at him for a few moments with the same scrutinizing look
      that he had already turned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo; he asked at length; &ldquo;back to the boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;not <i>jest</i> yet,&rdquo; answered Corbet, after a pause. &ldquo;The fact
      is, I was thinkin a little of takin a turn over Miramichi way&mdash;on
      business. I won&rsquo;t belong, and they&rsquo;ll be all right till I get back from
      Miramichi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, the boys&rsquo;ll have to wait for you, in the place where they now are,
      till you get back from Miramichi&mdash;so that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson spoke these words slowly and deliberately, with his eyes fixed on
      Captain Corbet. The latter looked somewhat uncomfortable, and for a while
      said nothing; but at length he murmured,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;about&mdash;it.&rdquo;

       style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>INDING that Captain Corbet was obstinate
      in his refusal to tell him about the boys, Ferguson at length desisted
      from his inquiries, and departed from the Antelope, much to the relief of
      the commander of that vessel. But, though he had left the Antelope, he had
      by no means given up his investigations into the cause of her present
      voyage. He at once rowed to the shore, with the intention of finding out
      from the people there what had been Corbet&rsquo;s business among them. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This he had no difficulty whatever in finding out. Corbet had come there
      with only one purpose, and this he had made known to every one with whom
      he came in contact, as best he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had picked up a man who spoke English, and this man had accompanied him
      in his rounds as interpreter. This very man fell into Ferguson&rsquo;s way, and
      from him Ferguson was able to learn that Captain Corbet&rsquo;s sole aim in
      visiting the Magdalen Islands was to obtain some sails. He learned that
      the sails, could not be obtained, and also that they had recommended him
      to go to Miramichi for them. By this he understood the reason why Captain
      Corbet was going to that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Ferguson had taken a great fancy to the boys; but the opinion which
      he had formed of Captain Corbet and the Antelope was of a very different
      kind. That opinion he had been at no pains to conceal. He had, in fact,
      expressed it freely and frequently. He had called Captain Corbet an &ldquo;old
      woman,&rdquo; and the Antelope &ldquo;a tub.&rdquo; This opinion he still cherished.
      Moreover, he had prophesied solemnly that the boys were more likely than
      not to land at the bottom of the sea before their voyage was over, and
      this prophecy he still believed in. In fact, the strong regard that he had
      conceived for these boys made him feel uneasy about them, and he did not
      like to think of them sailing about these seas with such a vessel and such
      a commander. The sudden appearance of the Antelope had excited his
      apprehensions. He had seen her come in while he was ashore. He had noticed
      her manoeuvres. He had watched her as she rounded to and then stood off
      again. He had then gone in his boat to watch her, and had seen her anchor.
      He had seen Captain Corbet go ashore with Wade. He had then rowed to her,
      boarded her, and examined her. The result of this examination was anything
      but satisfactory. He could not see any signs of the boys. All their
      luggage was gone. What had become of them was his first thought, and he
      had waited for the return of Captain Corbet in deep uneasiness.&rsquo; That
      uneasiness had only been increased when the captain returned and answered
      his questions in so evasive a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been prepared for this; the evasive answers of Captain Corbet
      irritated him, and awakened his suspicions. The secrecy which he threw
      around the movements of the boys was in the highest degree annoying. He
      had come hoping to find them on board. Their absence had filled him with
      uneasiness. In this state of uneasiness he had waited on board for hours,
      fidgeting and fuming; and the end of it all was, that when Captain Corbet
      did appear, he refused to answer the simplest questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several things that troubled and perplexed him to an unusual
      and a most unpleasant degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      First. What had become of the boys? Captain Corbet would not say. He had
      asked about every place in which it was possible that they could be, and
      had been told, most positively, that they were not there. Anticosti, Bay
      of Islands, Newfoundland, St. Pierre, St. Paul&rsquo;s, Gaspe, all the coasts
      surrounding the gulf he had asked after, and he had been told that they
      were in none of them. Where, then, could they be? Such secrecy puzzled and
      irritated him. Captain Corbet&rsquo;s story about the secret society did not
      deceive him for one instant. He saw through it all. He saw that Captain
      Corbet, though incapable of telling a falsehood, was yet willing to
      mislead, or to put him on a false track; but, for his part, he was not the
      man who could be easily misled or baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the discovery which he had made of the purpose which Captain
      Corbet had in visiting the Magdalen Islands. He had come for sails. Sails!
      What did he want of sails? What absurd project had he formed? And what had
      his search for sails to do with the absence of the boys? Yet, so great was
      Captain Corbet&rsquo;s desire to obtain sails, that he was going to Miramichi
      for that very purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, Ferguson could not forget the way in which Captain Corbet had
      come to the Magdalen Islands. He had come&mdash;he had appeared for a
      moment, as if about to anchor, but then had turned away, and sailed
      elsewhere. The whole manoeuvre had looked exactly like a wish to avoid the
      Fawn, and it might have been successful, had he not pursued so closely.
      Captain Corbet&rsquo;s appearance also, when he first came on the deck of the
      Antelope, and found himself confronted by his visitor, his start, his look
      of surprise, his confusion, his hesitation,&mdash;all these things made
      him seem the more open to suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspicion!
    </p>
    <p>
      And of what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Ferguson did not for a moment believe Captain Corbet capable of
      wrong. In fact, he looked upon him as an imbecile. Yet, even from that
      point of view, his uneasiness about the boys was none the less. These
      boys, under the care of an imbecile, seemed to him to be in as great peril
      as though their guardian had been a criminal. Where were they now? Had the
      folly or the imbecility of their captain drawn them into some position of
      danger? They were innocent and inexperienced; he was an imbecile; all were
      alike unprepared to encounter the dangers that might befall them; and from
      all these causes combined, the boys might now be in a position of very
      serious danger, while this incapable guardian was idly roaming the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought of all these things, the more uneasy he felt; until,
      at length, his fears about the safety of the boys, who had so suddenly
      awakened his interest, grew so strong, that he determined to keep Captain
      Corbet in sight. Believing that they were in some situation of possible
      danger, into which they had been drawn by their own ignorance and Captain
      Corbet&rsquo;s imbecility, and in which they were now left, Ferguson felt an
      intolerable anxiety, and so at length came to the conclusion to follow the
      Antelope, until some light should be thrown upon this mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Captain Corbet, having got rid of his troublesome visitor,
      waited patiently until the boat had rounded the projecting promontory of
      the island, and then proceeded to continue his voyage. He had already made
      up his mind to go to Mirami-chi, and this visit of Ferguson, together with
      his sharp inquiries, far from changing his purpose, had only served to
      intensify it. He only waited until the boat which contained his dreaded
      visitor was out of sight, in order to hurry his departure. Accordingly the
      anchor was weighed in the utmost haste, the sails hoisted, and soon the
      Antelope set forth on a fresh cruise. The wind was still light, yet
      sufficient for his purpose; and he directed his course around the island,
      so as to avoid, as far as possible, being seen by Ferguson. His knowledge
      of these waters was not very minute, yet it was sufficient to give him a
      general idea of his destination, and he steered the Antelope accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening came, and the Antelope continued on her course. All night long she
      traversed the waters, and on the following day approached the New
      Brunswick coast. Here Captain Corbet recognized the entrance to the Bay de
      Chaleur, and, turning southward, he sailed along the coast towards the
      Miramichi River. As he went on, he noticed a sail some miles away; but to
      this he paid no attention. It was a common enough thing in these waters,
      and there was no reason why he should notice it particularly. The sail
      remained in sight all that day; and at length, as he entered the Miramichi
      River and sailed up it, the fact that this stranger was following did not
      excite any attention on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three large towns lie on the Miramichi River,&mdash;Chatham, Douglastown,
      and Newcastle. Of these, two are a few miles from the mouth, on opposite
      sides of the stream&mdash;Chatham and Douglastown; and the three towns
      form together the centre of a great trade in ship-building, and in the
      exportation of deals and timber. Here may be found all that appertains to
      the outfit of a ship, and here Captain Corbet expected to procure what he
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening when the Antelope dropped anchor in the river opposite
      Chatham. It was then too late to do anything; so Captain Corbet had to
      postpone his business until the following day. Pleased with his prosperous
      voyage, and pleased still more with the easy way in which he had got rid
      of Ferguson, full of hope also in the successful completion of his
      business, he retired to bed that night, and slept placidly and profoundly.
      The wind that night arose, and blew hard; but the venerable captain, sunk
      in slumber, and surrounded by the river shores, heard nothing of the noise
      of the storm. Had he been out at sea, he would doubtless have thought of
      the boys in the distant ship; but here in the placid river there was
      nothing to mar his repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning Captain Corbet went ashore at Chatham, and began
      a search after the sails. The search took up some time, but at length he
      succeeded in finding what he wanted. He found some sails and rigging that
      had been taken from a condemned ship, and were held for sale. They had not
      been considered good enough for a ship&rsquo;s outfit, and had not only been
      torn and rent by storms, but also, from having been kept in a damp
      warehouse, they were somewhat mildewed. Still they served Captain Corbet&rsquo;s
      purpose as well as brand new ones could have done, and, in fact, even
      better, for their damaged condition enabled him to obtain them at a price
      which was commensurate with his means. It took some time to get these all
      stowed away properly in the Antelope; but at length the work was
      satisfactorily accomplished, and Captain Corbet emerged from the hold, and
      ascended upon deck, with a smile of serene satisfaction, and the peaceful
      consciousness that this had been a well-spent, day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with this smile of serenity and this tranquil breast did our good
      Captain Corbet emerge from the hold and ascend to the deck of the
      Antelope. Scarcely, however, had he set foot thereon, scarcely had he
      taken one look around, than the smile on his face faded away utterly, and
      the tranquillity of his soul was abruptly ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there, full before him, seated calmly on the rail, with a piece of
      soft pine stick in one hand, and a keen jackknife in the other, with a
      cigar in his mouth, and a pleasant glance in his eye,&mdash;there sat the
      dreaded Ferguson, the very man whom Captain Corbet most feared to see, and
      whom he believed to be far away at the Magdalen Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet stood rooted to the spot. His jaw dropped. He was
      paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>

      <a href="images/0149.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a nice run,&rdquo; said Ferguson. &ldquo;A snug place this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet did not answer. He was too confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you got your sails. I s&rsquo;pose you didn&rsquo;t have any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words increased the dismay of Captain Corbet. He thought that this
      would be a profound secret. Ferguson now showed that he knew it. He must
      have found out about this at the Magdalen Islands. Whether he knew any
      more or not, was a troublesome problem. Captain Corbet did not see how he
      could possibly know any more, and yet Ferguson had such a knowing look,
      that he would not have been surprised at learning that he knew all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got your sails,&rdquo; said Ferguson, as Captain Corbet did not
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, in a melancholy tone, and with a resigned look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty difficult to get hold of things of that sort in these parts,
      and you were lucky enough to get them so easy. They&rsquo;ll do for your
      purpose, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll do&mdash;well enough&mdash;considerin;
      just as well as if they was new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re going right back from this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right back?&rdquo; repeated Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you don&rsquo;t intend to go dawdling about any longer&mdash;do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going right straight back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I say right straight back,&rdquo; continued Ferguson, &ldquo;I mean, of
      course, right straight back to the boys. It&rsquo;s only the boys I consider. I
      feel anxious about them. I consider myself in some sort, just now, as
      responsible for their rescue, or, at any rate, for their safety; and, old
      man, let me warn you solemnly to be careful what you&rsquo;re about. Don&rsquo;t you
      go flitting about any longer in this style. Go you right straight back to
      where those boys are; if you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of Ferguson was earnest and anxious. Captain Corbet looked
      distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, railly, now,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;see here now; railly I do assure you, sir, the
      boys are all right, and all happy&mdash;plenty to eat, good quarters, and
      old Solomon to cook for them and make their beds. Why, you don&rsquo;t suppose
      I&rsquo;m made of iron, or that I&rsquo;d have the heart to leave them in any place
      except where they would be safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d leave them in any place that you might think
      dangerous, of course; but the trouble is you might leave them somewhere,
      not knowing it to be dangerous, while all the time it would be very
      dangerous indeed. Have you sailed much about these waters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal&mdash;n&mdash;no, not to say much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have; and let me tell you, it won&rsquo;t do to trust to your judgment
      where such precious things are concerned as the lives of those boys. I
      felt afraid, when I first saw the Antelope without the boys, that they had
      fallen into some difficulty through your ignorance or carelessness, and
      the moment I spoke to you about it, I felt convinced of it. It has worried
      me ever since. I took for granted that you were going back from the
      Magdalen Islands, and had no idea that you would venture so far away from
      them as this. When I learned your object, and saw where you were heading,
      I followed you on purpose to say what I now say; and that is, Go back, go
      back, old man, go back to the boys. I feel sure that they are in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t I going to go back?&rdquo; cried Captain Corbet, with as much
      vexation in his tone as could be showed by one of so amiable a nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I am, then,&mdash;thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Ferguson, standing up and getting over the side of
      the Antelope into his own boat; &ldquo;and one word more: don&rsquo;t you delay. Pile
      on all the sail this old tub&rsquo;ll carry, and get back to those boys as soon
      as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you needn&rsquo;t be a mite afeard,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, in a confident
      tone. &ldquo;Them thar boys are jest as safe as you and me. They&rsquo;re not only
      safe, but comfortable; yes, comfortable, and jolly, and lively, and happy,
      and safe, and sound. All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; I only hope it may turn out so,&rdquo; said Ferguson; and with
      these words he rowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet had spoken these last words in a very confident tone; but,
      in spite of this, he was by no means so confident as he seemed. In spite
      of himself, the warning words of Ferguson had sunk deep into his soul, and
      roused very deep anxiety. Now, too, that the great purpose of his voyage
      had been achieved, and the sails were actually lying stowed away in the
      hold, he had leisure to think of those boys, and of the situation in which
      he had left them. He had left them far longer than he had intended. He had
      been gone now three days. It might take two days to get back, and in case
      of a calm, it might take far longer. The thought of this filled him with
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson himself, had he been on board, would have commended the activity
      with which captain and mate now proceeded to hoist anchor and sail. In a
      very short time the Antelope was under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet&rsquo;s uneasiness grew greater. The warnings of Ferguson started
      up in his mind, and joined themselves to his recollections of the ship. He
      remembered how unwilling he had been to leave them, and how they had
      overpersuaded him. He began to lament that he had ever gone away. The
      vision of sudden wealth had lost all its charm, and no longer dazzled his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he passed out of the river into the gulf. Ever since he had
      started, the wind had been blowing more and more, and at length, on
      reaching the open sea, it was quite a gale. All around the waves tossed up
      their white caps, and the clouds scudded across the sky. This only
      increased the anxiety of the captain, and as he looked out upon the waste
      of waters, he trembled for the safety of those who were so helpless in
      that half-sunken ship. How would they endure this? For this he had not
      been prepared. He could not forgive himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that night he sailed on, full of grief and terror. The wind increased;
      the sea rose higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day came, and wind and sea were yet high. The progress of the
      Antelope was very good, and towards evening Captain Corbet reckoned that
      he must be approaching the place where the Petrel lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the shades of night came down, and nothing was visible. For a few
      hours Captain Corbet sailed on, and at length lay to. This must be the
      place, according to his calculations; and on the following morning he
      hoped to see the tall masts of the wrecked ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning came.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that night Captain Corbet had paced the deck in sleepless misery. With
      the first beam of dawn his eyes sought the horizon, and as the day grew
      brighter, he still sought eagerly in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose. It was broad day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But upon the face of the waters there was not a sign of the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one sail was visible, and that was a schooner far away to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet stood terror-struck, and looked all around with a face of
      despair.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE night after Captain
      Corbet left was spent by the boys without any incident of an unusual
      character. At first when they felt them-sleves thus cut off from all
      chance of leaving the vessel, there came over every one a singular sense
      of loneliness, together with an exhilarating feeling of independence.
      Their situation seemed to them like that of shipwrecked mariners on a
      desert island, and they all found the part of Robinson Crusoe a very
      pleasant one, under the circumstances. Their lodgings were excellent,
      their provisions varied and abundant; they had a cook who was master of
      his art; and they looked for the return of the Antelope within twenty-four
      hours. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet had laid stress upon this; and the only conditions upon
      which he consented to tear himself away from them had been, that he would
      not go farther than the Magdalen Islands. For he had fully counted on
      obtaining there what he needed, and had not made any calculations with
      reference to a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first evening, then, the boys were in high spirits, and interchanged
      many jocular remarks about their situation. Solomon expressed more than
      usual gratification, and seemed to have a serene self-satisfaction, which
      was extraordinary in him. As the shades of night descended he began to
      illuminate the cabin. He had found some oil, and had filled the lamp which
      hung immediately under the skylight. It was a large one, with four argand
      burners, and threw a brilliant lustre over the scene. Beneath this bright
      glow the boys sat at the evening repast, spread by the hands of Solomon,
      where they found the usual variety of dishes, and also not a few of quite
      a novel and original character. To play the part of Robinson Crusoe under
      such circumstances as these was not at all unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all the boys, then, there prevailed a spirit of joyousness, and old
      Solomon&rsquo;s mood was certainly not out of accord with that of his young
      companions. For Bart found him alone in his solitary galley, rubbing his
      thighs in front of a roasting fire, and chuckling audibly to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell ye what, Massa Bart,&rdquo; was his exclamation as he looked up at his
      smiling visitor, &ldquo;dis yer am high ole times, an no mistake; dis yer ole
      nigger habn&rsquo;t felt so happy an habn&rsquo;t had sich a strornary feelin of
      skewrity, ebber since he was your age. Let dat dar Ant&rsquo;lope keep way&rsquo;s
      long ebber she kin. I don want to see her again. I want to take up my bode
      in dis yer galley, and bid farewell to ebery feah, an wipe my weepin
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a curious fancy too,&rdquo; said Bart, in some surprise. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t mean to say that you&rsquo;d like to live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would so; dat dar&rsquo;s <i>jest</i> wat I mean, an it&rsquo;s wat&rsquo;d zactly suit dis
      yer ole man, an no mistake now&mdash;would so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, sympathetically, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a bad place just now, as
      long as the weather&rsquo;s fine, though how it might be in case of a blow, I
      confess I have my suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you nebber mind de blow. Dar&rsquo;s blows dat are a heap wuss dan de wind.
      How would you like blows on yer head, an backbone, an ribs, from a
      broomstick, or a shobbel, or a stick ob cord-wood, or a red-hot iron
      poker? Dem&rsquo;s blows as is blows, mind I tell you! Tell you what, when you
      come to git blows, like dat ar, you&rsquo;ll begin to hab a realizin sense ob
      what blows is possible for to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Solomon, how very feelingly you speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feelinly! Ony wait till you&rsquo;ve felt ober your head an shoulders what
      she&rsquo;s giben me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon gave a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know her. You&mdash;saw her at Loch&mdash;Lomond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, your wife! O, I understand;&rdquo; and a light began to dawn upon Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon shuddered. The remembrance was too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis yer&rsquo;s de fust time I&rsquo;ve felt real safe for ebber so long; and here I
      am real safe. She can&rsquo;t git at me here no how. She can&rsquo;t imagine where I
      am no how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense, Solomon! Haven&rsquo;t you been safe enough ever since you left
      St. John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sah! Safe! Why, dar&rsquo;s not a moment ob de day dat I don&rsquo;t fancy dat ar
      woman&rsquo;s arter me&mdash;on my back. I knows it. Tell you what, she&rsquo;s a
      comin to fetch me. I knows it. I feel it in my bones, and dat ar&rsquo;s a
      feelin dat&rsquo;s wuss dan de rheumatics. &rsquo;Tis so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a rdiculous fancy!&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Do you really mean to say that
      you believe she will come after you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so. No doubt bout dat ar, Mas&rsquo;r Bart. She&rsquo;s a comin jest as shuah&rsquo;s
      you&rsquo;re born. An I habn&rsquo;t felt real safe&rsquo; till now. Here I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose she does come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, s&rsquo;pposin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can she do to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do! Lots ob tings. She can come and lib whar I lib, an hamma away all day
      an all night on my ole head wid broomsticks an pokers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what makes you let her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her? Wat can I do bout it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the law&rsquo;ll protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be law sakes, chile! Don&rsquo;t you know de law can&rsquo;t &rsquo;tect husbands
      agin wives? It&rsquo;ll only &rsquo;tect wives agin husbands. My pinion is, dat
      de law&rsquo;s clean in fabor ob de women, an de men hain&rsquo;t got no chance&mdash;not
      a mite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this new view of the law Bart was somewhat nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll ever trouble you again. You&rsquo;ll
      go back to the academy, and Dr. Porter&rsquo;ll take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;fifty millium Docta Porta&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t do anythin
      agin dat ar woman if she come to fetch me. De &rsquo;cadmy ain&rsquo;t no place
      for me. Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll eber catch me back dar. Ise boun to be a rober;
      an I&rsquo;ll sail de sea, so as to prebent her from eber a gittin on my track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, nonsense!&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come with us, and it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon shook his head, and relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it became time to prepare for bed. Solomon had already arranged
      the state-rooms and made the beds. Thanks to their assiduous care, the
      rooms and the bedding were all quite dry and very inviting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful night. There was a gentle breeze, which made a slight
      ripple on the water, but there was not enough to raise a sea. There was a
      slight motion on the ship, as she slowly rose and fell to the long and
      gentle undulations; but the motion was scarcely perceptible, and certainly
      did not interfere in the slightest degree with the comfort of those on
      board. It was about ten o&rsquo;clock when they retired for the night. They went
      to the different rooms which had fallen to their lot. The excitement of
      the day and of the evening, the long fatigues, together with the
      exhaustion arising from former privations, all conspired to make their
      sleep this night very profound as well as very refreshing. Solomon sat
      till midnight toasting his shins in front of the galley fire, and
      meditating about the strange vicissitudes of life which had brought across
      his path that being whom he so justly feared. But Solomon&rsquo;s thoughts
      gradually became intermingled with the confused fancies of the land of
      Nod; and at length awaking with a start, he rubbed his sleepy eyes, and
      carried his aged frame somewhere &ldquo;for&rsquo;ard.&rdquo; None of the party awoke until
      late on the following day. Then, on opening their eyes, their nostrils
      were greeted with savory odors that were wafted from the cabin, which
      served to show them that Solomon, at least, had not overslept himself, but
      that he was up and doing, and that he had prepared everything that might
      be needed to fortify them for the cares and trials of a new day. For the
      savory odors that were wafted to their nostrils were multifarious, and
      among them each boy, before he had made up his mind to rise, and while he
      was still enjoying that luxurious doze that follows the awakening from
      sleep, could have enumerated, had he felt inclined, the strong, rich aroma
      of coffee, the pungent odor of broiled ham, the gentler steam of
      distilling tea, the appetizing atmosphere shed forth from hot rolls,
      together with a confused medley of others equally attractive, though less
      definable. .
    </p>
    <p>
      A rush upon deck to breathe the glorious air, and to look upon the scene
      around, followed. The view was most enlivening. Far and wide around them
      extended the deep blue water, whereon not a sail was visible. Overhead
      hung the azure vault of heaven, with not a cloud in all its wide expanse.
      The wind was light, and blew at intervals, nor had it increased since the
      night before. They took their morning bath on deck in the cool, refreshing
      salt water, dipped out fresh from the sea. Pat improved on this, for he
      undressed himself again, and plunged into the sea, where he swam about,
      and called on the others to follow. His example was infectious, and soon
      the whole party were floundering and gamboling in the water, like a shoal
      of porpoises, beside the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bath was a most refreshing one, and added to the zest with which they
      attacked their breakfast. When, at length, this repast was finished, they
      once more came forth to the deck like giants refreshed, and began to make
      plans for passing the time. For their active young natures, filled to
      overflowing with animal spirits, some lively exercise was needed. This
      they found in an exploring tour among the rigging. Bart went first, and
      then the others. Each one tried to venture farther than the others. Thus
      it soon became a game&mdash;the well-known one often played at sea in fine
      weather called &ldquo;follow my leader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart&rsquo;s training in a seaport town gave him an advantage over the others,
      even though some of them were stronger, and others more active than he.
      But he had all through his boyhood been familiar with ships, and had
      ventured time and again to every part. There was no height so dizzy but
      that he had sought it out and familiarized himself with it. Bart,
      therefore, on the present occasion easily surpassed the others in feats of
      daring, and ventured where none of the others could follow. Singularly
      enough, it was Phil who came nearest to him. His light, lithe, slender,
      yet sinewy frame made him as nimble as a kitten in the rigging, and if he
      had only had Bart&rsquo;s practice and familiarity, he would have decidedly
      surpassed him. Phil came near enough to Bart to elicit the admiration and
      the applause of all. Next to Phil came Pat, who was very sinewy and
      active. Bruce and Arthur were about equal, while Tom, who, though very
      strong, was somewhat slow and a little awkward, lingered in the rear. This
      exciting sport served to occupy several of the hours of that summer
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at length they had exhausted the utmost resources of even so
      fascinating a game as &ldquo;follow my leader,&rdquo; and they once more came down to
      the common level of every-day life, when they proceeded to debate the
      great question what next to do. A swim about the ship served to settle
      this question until dinner time, after which the important subject of
      dinner remained under discussion long enough to consume a few more hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner none of them felt very much inclined to take any active
      exertion, and they distributed themselves about in various ways. At length
      Bart suggested a regatta, which was at once adopted. Not having books to
      read, or anything else in particular to attend to, it was not surprising
      that they should take with much excitement to a sport which, though
      perhaps decidedly childish, is yet not without its attractions to the
      unoccupied mind. The plan was for each boy to make a boat, put it over the
      side, and see which one of the little fleet would beat. These boats were
      at first made of paper. But paper was soon found inadequate, and wood was
      resorted to. These wooden boats were long and sharp, and sailed with a
      speed which excited the warmest interest. At length Bart proposed a new
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding a piece of iron hoop, he broke it into short fragments, and
      sticking this underneath a wooden boat, so that it might act as ballast,
      keel, and rudder all in one, he produced a little vessel that would sail
      with the wind abeam, and carry an astonishing amount of canvas. Soon a
      fleet of these little vessels was formed, and the regatta went on with
      fresh excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a bright thought struck Phil, which, on being suggested to the
      other boys, at once caused all interest in the regatta to be eclipsed by
      the stronger attraction of this new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nothing less than to make candy.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this there was a double attraction, for, first, the candy was of
      value in itself, and secondly, the process of cooking it would, afford an
      occupation at once charming and exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was sugar on board, both brown and white, and also molasses. The
      choice among these was the subject of a prolonged debate; but at length,
      on being put to the vote, it was found that the Molassesites were, in a
      triumphant majority. Upon this the White Sugarites and the Brown Sugarites
      waved their objections, and the vote became a unanimous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another debate took place upon the appointment of a cook, which was
      terminated by a resolve to ballot for one. The result of the balloting was
      the unanimous election of Phil to that important and responsible post.
      This was nothing more than was right, and it was a handsome tribute to
      Phil for being the originator of the whole scheme. Phil, on being informed
      of his election, responded in a neat speech, which was greeted with loud
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      A motion was then made that a deputation be sent to Solomon, requesting
      him to vacate the cook&rsquo;s galley for a few hours, so that the new purpose
      of the assembly might be carried into successful accomplishment. This
      motion was carried, and the deputation was chosen by ballot. The deputies
      were Bart, chairman, Bruce, Arthur, Tom, and Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the departure of these on their mission, the whole assemblage
      consisted of Phil. Though alone, he contrived to represent the assemblage
      with as much dignity as possible, for he laid himself down flat on the
      deck, and distributed his arms and legs in all directions, so that he
      might occupy as much space as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputation at length returned, and announced to the assembly that
      their mission had been successful, and that Solomon had kindly consented
      to give up to them the cook&rsquo;s galley for the required time and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the assembly moved, seconded, and carried unanimously a
      resolution that the report of the deputation be adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this an adjournment took place <i>sine die</i>, and the meeting
      retired to the scene of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a gallon of molasses was procured. This was poured into an iron pot,
      and Phil stationed himself at his post in the galley. The fire was
      supplied with fresh fuel, and soon the liquid began to boil. Phil stirred
      away like a good fellow, and the liquid began to froth up. Phil tried to
      keep it down, so that it might not boil over. For some time there was a
      desperate struggle between Phil and the molasses. The boys stood crowding
      around, watching that struggle with intense interest and keen excitement.
      None of them offered to make a suggestion, for it was felt that any offer
      of advice would be derogatory to the dignity of Phil&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the struggle went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew fiercer and fiercer every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the molasses rose up in wrath and fury, and seemed about to rush forth
      from its iron prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Phil, summoning all his energy, dealt a series of destructive blows at
      his furious enemy, and laid him low for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So went the struggle. Now the molasses gained, now Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the time the molasses was increasing in fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys stood about. They formed themselves into two parties, one
      embracing the cause of the molasses, the other that of Phil. Cheer after
      cheer arose as one or the other saw its cause in the ascendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil grew weaker and fainter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he tried to make a flank attack, and tore open the stove doors
      so as to lessen the draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had he torn open the doors than the molasses, rising in its wrath,
      rushed forth, streamed over, and poured out in resistless strength,
      driving Phil himself back from the clouds of hot steam that arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil fled vanquished from the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The molasses had conquered!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild cheers arose from the Molassesites.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when the smoke and steam had subsided, Phil ventured back.
      There was a boiling, foaming mass still in the pot; but on lifting it off
      the stove, and allowing it to subside for a moment, it was found that not
      more than a quart was left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an here&rsquo;s some lovely flavorin I found,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;in the pantry.
      It&rsquo;ll make a good flavorin to the candy, so it will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held forth a small vial to Phil, which was labelled,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Extract of Lemon.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil thought it would be an improvement, and so poured the whole contents
      of the vial into the boiling molasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      His task was soon over, and the candy was taken off, and poured into
      dishes to cool. There was only a little, but it was hoped that this might
      suffice for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they ventured to taste it. But the first taste excited one
      universal cry of execration. The taste was of rancid oil, and not by any
      means the smooth, sweet, delicious lemon-flavored molasses candy for which
      they had waited so long. In bitter disappointment and vexation, Phil
      seized the vial which Pat had handed him. He smelt it; he poured some of
      the last drops out on his hand, and touched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, with a rueful look, &ldquo;the steward of the Petrel must have
      taken a lemon bottle to keep his hair-oil in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all the boys retired from the cook&rsquo;s galley with a mournful smile.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE boys thus succeeded in filling the
      day with sufficient incidents to occupy their thoughts. It was not an
      unpleasant day; indeed, it was afterwards looked back upon by all of them
      as one of the marked days in their lives. True, most of the molasses had
      been lost, and the remainder, which had been turned into candy, had not
      been recommended to their palates by the addition of the hair-oil of the
      steward of the Petrel; but to active-minded boys these little
      disappointments caused no trouble whatever; on the contrary, they only
      furnished material for endless jests and laughter. The conclusion of the
      whole affair was reached when the party once more formed themselves into a
      meeting, at which it was moved, seconded, and unanimously voted, &ldquo;that the
      thanks of this meeting be conveyed to Solomon for his generous loan of the
      cook&rsquo;s galley.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Tom, who always was remarkably fruitful in devices, conceived
      the idea of making a checker-board. He was able to do this without any
      very great difficulty. He obtained the head of a flour barrel, and with
      some soot and water he was able to mark out the squares very well indeed.
      He then obtained the covers of some red herring boxes, which he cut up
      into the checker pieces, blackening them with soot. He then challenged
      Bruce to a game. Bruce played, and won; but, as at the end of that time
      Bruce, who had chosen the black men, found his fingers and face all
      covered with soot, and his fingers, moreover, smelling most abominably of
      stale red herring, his victory did not seem to give him that satisfaction
      which it might be supposed to have caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fired by Tom&rsquo;s example, Phil undertook a more ambitious task, which was
      nothing less than to make a set of chess-men. He went about the pantry,
      and succeeded in finding a number of corks, which he attempted to cut into
      the required shapes. His knife, however, was rather dull, and he himself
      was not particularly skilful at carving; so that when the pieces were
      completed, it required a great effort of the imagination to see the
      connection between the corks and the pieces which they were supposed to
      represent, and a still greater effort of memory to retain the recollection
      of such resemblance. He challenged Bart to a game, and the two attempted
      to play; but, after a dozen moves, attended by a dozen disputes, the game
      resolved itself into an insoluble problem as to whether a certain piece,
      belonging to Phil, was a pawn or a queen. All present took part in the
      discussion, but, after a long debate, it was left undecided; and so the
      game broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea they adjourned to the quarter-deck. Here all was pleasant, and
      soothing, and agreeable. A gentle breeze still blew as before, and the
      prospect of this tranquil weather continued. The boys sang, and told
      stories, and chatted for hours. They speculated much as to the time when
      the Antelope might be expected back again. Some thought that she might be
      back by the evening of the next day, but others were inclined to allow her
      a longer time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I think well have to allow about three days&mdash;one
      day to go to the Magdalen Islands, one day to hunt up the sails, and one
      day to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, he needn&rsquo;t be so long as that,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;I should think he could
      get to the Magdalen Islands in far less time. They can&rsquo;t be over fifty
      miles away, and this breeze would take him there in fifteen hours or so.
      He left here at about six yesterday; he probably got there at about twelve
      to-day. He could hunt all over the islands before dark at farthest; and,
      of course, he&rsquo;ll come straight back after he gets the sails. He probably
      left there this evening at sundown, and he may be here to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I dare say he did leave this evening to
      come back; but, mind you, my boy, this wind&rsquo;s against him. He&rsquo;ll have to
      tack coming back, and the Antelope isn&rsquo;t much at that. I don&rsquo;t believe
      he&rsquo;ll do it by to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days, I think, will have to be allowed,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, three days ought to do it at the farthest,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He certainly
      won&rsquo;t wait at the Magdalen Islands. The only thing that&rsquo;ll keep him&rsquo;ll be
      the head winds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; for my part,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;he may stay three weeks, if he likes.
      This place is over an over again betther than the Antelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well while the wind is this
      way, but if an easterly or southerly wind should come up, it wouldn&rsquo;t be
      so comfortable. A heavy sea would roll through and through the cabin, and
      we&rsquo;d have to live, and eat, and sleep up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an ayvin that wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it were to rain at the same time,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it might be a
      little damp up here; and I&rsquo;m afraid we wouldn&rsquo;t have quite so good a
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope that the Antelope&rsquo;ll get back before it begins to blow,&rdquo; said
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all very well in fine weather; for I&rsquo;d rather be
      on board here than in the Antelope; but if the weather is going to change,
      I&rsquo;d a precious sight rather have the Antelope within hail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Phil, cheerily, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no sign of a blow just yet, at
      any rate; so I suppose we needn&rsquo;t talk about that. I&rsquo;ve no doubt this
      weather&rsquo;ll hold on for a day or so longer, and by that time, at the
      farthest, the Antelope will be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Antelope were really in sight,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I
      should give one thought to the weather; but the fact that she is away
      makes the subject a very important one. This head wind may detain her, and
      if it were to blow hard, it would be bad for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;I believe that if it did blow hard, the wind would
      change; and in that case, it would be all the more favorable for the
      Antelope, and, of course, bring her here all the faster. So, at the worst,
      our hardships couldn&rsquo;t last more than a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal in that,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were their speculations as to the Antelope; but all these, together
      with all apprehensions of danger, and all fears about the change of
      weather, were soon forgotten in a sound and refreshing sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning came, and their conversation of the previous night made
      every one think of the Antelope. On going upon deck, their first thought
      was of her. But of the Antelope there was not a sign, nor was any sail
      visible whatever. Little did they imagine that at that moment, instead of
      steering his bark back to them, Captain Corbet was sailing away from them,
      and directing his course to Miramichi. But the weather was fine, and the
      breeze was still mild; and so, after one glance around, they all dismissed
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast, and morning occupations, and games, and swimming, and various
      other pastimes, took up the interval until midday, when dinner came to
      engage their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      On going upon deck after dinner, they noticed a change in the appearance
      of sea and sky. Clouds were visible on the horizon, and the wind had
      shifted. It was blowing from another quarter. It had been north-east. It
      was now south-east. It was also a little stronger than it had been, and
      created more than a ripple on the water. The surface of the sea was now
      agitated, and the halcyon times of calm had passed. The boys noted all
      these things at one glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be rough,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;The wind has changed, and it&rsquo;s going
      to blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;let it blow. It&rsquo;ll be fair for the Antelope, and
      fetch her up all the faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ill wind that blows no good,&rdquo; said Tom, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her rip,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were not by any means inclined to borrow trouble, and so they
      soon drove away these thoughts, and began to get up amusements of the old
      sort. They ransacked the cabin, they peered into places heretofore
      neglected. Nothing, however, of any particular interest rewarded their
      searches. So the afternoon passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea table was set. Solomon did his best. All praised the repast, as
      something of a superior order. This time Solomon did not kindle, and glow,
      and chuckle at the praises of his young friends, but preserved a demeanor
      of unchangeable gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat at table, they all noticed a slight motion in the vessel,
      which would not have been regarded under ordinary circumstances, but which
      now, in their very peculiar situation, excited comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind is increasing,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say we&rsquo;ll have a blow to-night,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s much more motion, we must expect to get a ducking,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;my berth&rsquo;s out of the reach of the water; it&rsquo;s the
      upper one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, thin, an I&rsquo;ll have to change my berth to an upper one,&rdquo; said Pat,
      &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;re thinkin of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be all the better for the Antelope. The wind
      won&rsquo;t be much, after all. We&rsquo;ll only feel it because we&rsquo;re so low in the
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, of course,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;and if the worst comes to the worst, we can go
      to the quarterdeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change in their prospects, however, did not in the slightest degree
      affect the appetite of the boys; but, on the contrary, they exhibited a
      greater devotion than ordinary to this repast, as though they were all
      under the impression that this might be the last one which they were to
      eat under such luxurious circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      This impression, if it did exist, was confirmed after tea, when they went
      out upon deck. Solomon was there, grave and preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilen,&rdquo; said he, in a mild voice, &ldquo;we mus get some &rsquo;visium up dis
      yar ebenin on to dat ar quarter-deck. I ben a riggin some tackle to hist
      up some barls ob biscuit. Dar&rsquo;s water up dar already, two barls, an dat&rsquo;ll
      be nuff for de present. You&rsquo;ll all hab to len a han, an hist up biscuit
      barls; an you can fotch up as many oder tings as you can lay yer hans on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, let&rsquo;s wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; bes be in time,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gwine to blow dis yer
      night, an we&rsquo;ve got to work so as to hab all tings ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of the boys were surprised at this; so they all prepared to lend a
      hand at the work. This was, as Solomon said, to hoist up some barrels of
      biscuit. These they rolled out from the store-room, and hoisted up to the
      quarter-deck. They then lashed them round the mizzenmast securely. Two
      stout seamen&rsquo;s chests were then brought up, being first emptied of their
      contents, and into these the boys packed an assortment of such articles of
      food as might be desirable in the event of a prolonged stay on the
      quarter-deck, such as two hams, which Solomon, with wise forethought, had
      boiled, cheese, potted meats, knives, forks, mustard, butter, salt, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now felt prepared to some extent for the worst; but the question
      still remained, how they were to procure shelter in the event of rain. A
      diligent search resulted in the discovery of several tarpaulins. These
      they hung over the boom, securing the ends on each side to the deck in
      such a way that a tent was formed, which was spacious enough to shelter
      them all in case of need, and quite impervious to water. In the middle of
      this tent rose the skylight, which might serve for a table, or even a
      sleeping-place, in case of need. Upon the top of this they spread some
      mattresses and blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar,&rdquo; said Solomon, &ldquo;dat ar&rsquo;s de best dat we can do; an if dis yer wind&rsquo;s
      boun to rise, an dis yer vessel&rsquo;s decks get a swimmin wid water, we&rsquo;ll be
      able to hab a dry place to lib in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll have to use it,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
      nothing like having things ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll sleep all the sounder for this,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like knowing that we&rsquo;ve got a place to run to, if the
      worst comes to the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, even if the sea does wash over the decks,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;all
      we&rsquo;ve got to do is, to take off our shoes and stockings, roll up our
      trousers, and meander about barefoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an there&rsquo;s a good deal to be said in favor of goin barefoot,&rdquo;
       remarked Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll only be for a little while; for I&rsquo;ve no
      doubt that the Antelope&rsquo;ll be along some time to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, we can get our sleep this night in our beds,&rdquo; said Arthur.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to my old crib, and I mean to sleep there, too, till I&rsquo;m washed
      out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sure an meself will do that same too,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;we&rsquo;d be great fools not to sleep there as long
      as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind had increased a little, but not much, and the motion of the ship
      was, after all, but slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather the prospect before them than the present reality that had
      led to these preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three hours passed, and ten o&rsquo;clock came. By that time the wind had
      increased to a fresh, strong breeze, and the sea had risen into moderate
      waves. The motion of the ship had grown to be a slow, regular rise and
      fall of about two feet. On walking to the bows, they saw that at every
      rise and fall the water came in through the scupper-holes and flowed over
      the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there it comes,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;but for my part, I persist in refusing
      to believe that it&rsquo;ll be anything of consequence. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;ll
      get into the cabin. As to the deck here, a thorough washing&rsquo;ll do it good.
      I was thinking to-day that it needed one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;ll not be much,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an where&rsquo;s the harrum,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;if it does come into the cabin,
      so long as we&rsquo;re high up in our berths, out of reach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon&rsquo;ll have trouble in cooking to-morrow,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll feed on biscuit,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;A few days ago we&rsquo;d have been
      glad enough to be where we are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;and, besides, tomorrow the Antelope&rsquo;ll be
      almost sure to be here. This wind&rsquo;s fair, and as I&rsquo;ve always said, what&rsquo;s
      bad for us in one way is best for us in another, for-it&rsquo;ll bring the
      Antelope along all the faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this way they all made light of the change that had taken place; and,
      turning away, they all went to the cabin and retired to their respective
      berths. The lamp under the skylight was burning brightly, the cabin had
      its usual cheerful appearance, and the comforts here served still more to
      make them overlook the troubles outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few hours they slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were awakened by a cry&mdash;a wild, wailing cry, a cry of
      terror and of despair. Every one started up at once. The cry came again
      from the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, chilen, we&rsquo;re lost! we&rsquo;re done for! we&rsquo;re ru-i-na-ted for ebbemo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Solomon!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;What are you making all that row about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he said this he jumped out of his berth. As he entered the cabin
      one glance reassured him partially. The lamps were burning; they had
      allowed them to burn for this night; the floor was dry. Everything had the
      same air of comfort which had prevailed when they retired. The motion of
      the ship was certainly greater, perhaps even much greater; but under any
      other circumstances it would not have been noticed. This much Bart saw
      first; and then he noticed a figure bowed over the table, sighing and
      groaning. It was Solomon. His head was buried in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Bart, laying his hand on Solomon&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter? What&rsquo;s upset you so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon raised his head and grasped Bart&rsquo;s arm convulsively in both of his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;s ghosts about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghosts?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mas&rsquo;r Bart; d-d-d-dars g-g-ghosts a-b-b-b-bout,&rdquo; said Solomon, with
      a shudder and with chattering teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense! What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time all the other boys were out in the cabin. They had all gone
      to bed with their clothes on, and stood now wide awake and prepared for
      any emergency. They all stared fixedly at Solomon, expecting to hear some
      dreadful disclosure. They had never before seen him so completely upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;s g-g-ghosts a-b-b-b-b-b-b-oard,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;I went to bed. I
      waked at de row dey made down below, in de hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in the hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-y-yes, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, in d-d-d-d-e hole ob de ship. It&rsquo;s a haunted ship&mdash;an&mdash;full
      ob hobgobblums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Bart, with a sigh of relief; &ldquo;is that all? Some nightmare or
      other. Never mind, old Solomon; it&rsquo;s all right; we&rsquo;ll go and lay the
      ghosts. You come and show me the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darsn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; gasped Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll come with us, you know; we&rsquo;ll all go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-d-d-arsn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Solomon again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go, and T think it&rsquo;ll be better for you to come with us than
      to stay here alone,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Come along, boys; let&rsquo;s find out what it
      is. Perhaps something&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other boys followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon gave one wild glance around, and then, finding himself forsaken,
      and dreading the loneliness, he hurried after the others.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T the alarm of Solomon, the boys thus
      all hurried out upon deck. The night was dark. The sky was overcast. The
      motion of the ship was greater than it had been. As they stepped out, they
      felt their feet plash in a stream of water that rolled towards them, and
      perceived by this that the waves had risen high enough to break over the
      low-lying deck. But it was only enough to wet the deck, and not enough to
      cause either alarm or even discomfort, since it had not penetrated to the
      cabin. As they advanced forward, however, they encountered deeper streams
      of water, which swept down from the bows towards them, rising as high as
      their ankles. Yet even this excited but little attention. Solomon&rsquo;s alarm
      had prepared them all for something serious, and so slight a thing as this
      was not deemed worthy of notice. They hurried on, therefore, and at length
      having reached the forecastle, they stood and looked all around. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion of the vessel would have been considered very ordinary in any
      one differently situated. The waves had risen somewhat, and at their
      motion the ship rose and fell about four feet. This was sufficient to
      bring her deck under the surface of the sea, and at each fall the water
      streamed in and rolled about. The wind was rather fresh, but not by any
      means violent, and it sighed through the rigging overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Solomon,&rdquo; said Bart, at length, &ldquo;what do you mean? I don&rsquo;t see that
      anything&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon had been clinging to the outskirts of the party, and at this he.
      cried out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey ain&rsquo;t out dar! Dey&rsquo;s inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inside? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In dar!&rdquo; said Solomon, pointing to the door of the forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Bart went in, followed by all the boys. A dim lamp was burning,
      suspended from a beam. The boys looked around, and saw the seamen&rsquo;s
      berths, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything here,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Solomon grasped Bart&rsquo;s arm, and said, with a gasp,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; you listen to &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys all listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they listened, there arose a confused medley of sounds, which seemed to
      come from the hold of the ship&mdash;sounds of pounding, thumping, and
      grinding, mingled with groanings, gurglings, sobs, choking sighs, squeals,
      scrapings, rumblings, tumblings, shiverings, and many others of an
      indefinable character. To these the boys all listened in silence, and for
      a time there came a solemn feeling of awe over every one of that little
      band of listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-d-d-dem&rsquo;s um!&rdquo; said Solomon, with a shudder. &ldquo;D-d-d-dem&rsquo;s d-d-de
      g-g-g-ghosts, d-d-d-dem&rsquo;s d-d-de hobble-bobble-gobblums!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that trash just now. This may be
      something serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cargo seems moving,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;The leak may be a large one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she&rsquo;s got a bad strain,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; said Arthur, solemnly, &ldquo;that she won&rsquo;t last very
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my own idea,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Come, boys, we may as well look the worst
      in the face. It&rsquo;s my opinion that she&rsquo;s breaking up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got the captain&rsquo;s gig,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;an can take to that, so we
      can. We&rsquo;ve got lots of provisions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve no oars,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can rig up a bit of a sail, so we can, out of thim ould
      tarpowlines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, though,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;she may not be breaking up. I&rsquo;ve heard
      somewhere that in a water-logged ship the water makes the most
      extraordinary noises ever heard whenever there is the slightest motion; so
      these may, after all, be nothing more than the usual noises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides, what is this sea!&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t do anything; it&rsquo;s
      nothing. In fact, the more I think of it, the more sure I feel that this
      ship can&rsquo;t break up, unless she strikes a rock. I remember what sea
      captains have told me&mdash;that a timber ship may float and drift about
      for fifty years, and hold together without any trouble, unless it should
      strike a rock or be driven ashore. So now that I think of it, I don&rsquo;t
      believe there&rsquo;s the slightest danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if that is so, why did the captain of the Petrel desert her? He must
      have known this, if it is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was Tom&rsquo;s objection, who was not quite inclined to receive Bart&rsquo;s
      assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dare say he hadn&rsquo;t been in the timber trade,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;This
      was something new for him, and he thought she would go to pieces. That&rsquo;s
      what he wrote in the message that he put in the bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation had not been lost on Solomon, whose fears, prompted by
      superstition, gradually faded away, and finally died out. The true cause
      of the terrific noises being thus asserted and accepted by the boys, there
      was no difficulty on Solomon&rsquo;s part about adopting it. Accordingly he soon
      regained his ordinary equanimity, and began to potter about the
      forecastle, arranging some dishes and pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent of Solomon from the supernatural to the commonplace had a good
      effect upon the boys, who, seeing that he had suddenly lost all his fears,
      thought it time to throw aside their own anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use of staying in this dismal
      forecastle any longer, when there is a comfortable cabin aft; so I&rsquo;m going
      back to my berth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s meself,&rdquo; cried Pat, &ldquo;that was jist goin to say that same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about the best thing we can do, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      no danger just yet, evidently, and so there&rsquo;s no reason why we should lose
      our night&rsquo;s rest. Let&rsquo;s sleep while we can, say I, and I dare say the
      Antelope&rsquo;ll be along some time to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this proposal the boys acted forthwith, and soon they were all not
      only back again in their berths, but slumbering profoundly. Solomon also
      turned in &ldquo;forard,&rdquo; and finished his night&rsquo;s sleep, which, however, was
      frequently interrupted by excursions and reconnoitrings which he made for
      the purpose of seeing how the weather was.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning they all awaked early, and hurried upon deck.
      This was the third day since the Antelope had left, and by evening the
      three days would be completed which they allowed for her probable absence.
      There was not one of them who did not go up on deck that morning with the
      expectation of seeing her somewhere in the distance. But on looking
      around, they saw no sail of any kind. It was with a feeling of
      disappointment that they recognized this fact, for, though thus far they
      had not encountered any danger, they had, at least, become aware of the
      fact that an increase of wind might make their situation very dangerous
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind also had grown stronger, and sang through the rigging in a way
      that was anything but music to their ears. The sky was overcast with
      rolling clouds. In another vessel they would have called it a fine day,
      and a fresh breeze, but to them it became equivalent to a storm. The waves
      had risen to a height commensurate with the increase of the wind. The rise
      and fall of the ship amounted to about six feet, and at every other plunge
      her bows went entirely under water. The deck was now completely flooded,
      and Solomon in traversing it was sometimes up to his knees in the rushing
      torrent. The fire in the cook&rsquo;s galley had been put out, and he had been
      compelled to transfer his apparatus to the stove in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarter-deck astern prevented the sea from coming aboard in that
      direction; and by the time the water that rolled over the bows had reached
      the cabin doors, it had greatly subsided; yet still enough had poured into
      the cabin to saturate it in every nook and corner. A pool of water filled
      all the cabin and all the state-rooms to a depth of six inches, and rolled
      about with the motion of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t certainly quite as comfortable as it might be,&rdquo; said
      Phil, with a blank look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this rate,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;if this, sort of thing keeps on, we&rsquo;ll have to
      launch the boat, and row to the cook&rsquo;s galley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange that the Antelope isn&rsquo;t in sight!&rdquo; said Arthur, shading his
      eyes, and trying to force them to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said Bart, who had been peering through the glass, and now
      handed it to Arthur. &ldquo;No use. There&rsquo;s not only no Antelope, but no other
      vessel; in fact, there&rsquo;s not a sign of any sail of any kind whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Arthur, who had already exhausted all the capabilities of the
      spy-glass, took it, and began sweeping the entire circuit of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t trouble yourselves, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite time yet
      for the Antelope to get here. We allowed her three days. They won&rsquo;t be up
      till evening. Besides, she&rsquo;s just as likely to be four days; she&rsquo;s not
      over fast. For my part, I don&rsquo;t intend to look for her to-day at all. It&rsquo;s
      quite possible that a vessel may heave in sight; but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;ll
      be the Antelope. And if any vessel does turn up, we can easily signalize,
      for I found all the signal-flags of the Petrel in the closet next my
      state-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That morning Solomon had to cook the breakfast in the cabin. The boys all
      concluded to go about barefoot. The breakfast was cooked, and, considering
      all the circumstances, was a great success; but the glory of the cabin had
      departed, and it was hardly to be expected that a breakfast could be
      thoroughly enjoyable at which one had to sit with the water playing all
      about his feet and ankles. Still the boys made the best of it, and did
      ample justice to the fare. Solomon still struggled manfully against the
      difficulties of his position, and on this occasion actually furnished them
      with hot rolls. These, with broiled ham, coffee, tea, and other things,
      made a breakfast that was not to be despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the boys were glad to leave the cabin, and seek the
      quarter-deck, which arose like an island out of the water. They began to
      look upon this quarter-deck as a place that was likely to become their
      home. The sashes of the skylight were kept open and made use of, as
      affording a readier means of passing in and out of the cabin. They began
      to feel very seriously the restriction of space which had been caused by
      the flowing waters, and the charms of the comfortable cabin had never
      seemed so great as when they were deprived of them. Formerly they had been
      able to lounge in and out, and, above all, to prolong the various repasts,
      and thus pass away the time; but now breakfast, dinner, and tea had to be
      hurried over as rapidly as possible, and there came the prospect of final
      banishment from the cabin altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea at midday was somewhat rougher; but Solomon heroically cooked the
      dinner in the cabin, although the water was sometimes half way up to his
      knees. Measures were now taken to keep the water out. The door was shut
      and locked, and in the interstices they fastened oakum. Had this been done
      at the first, the cabin might have been saved; but unfortunately it had
      been neglected, and now that the water was in, there was no way of getting
      it out. Still this was a decided improvement, and there was comfort in the
      thought that it could not grow any worse now, unless it became very bad
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was served in the cabin, and the boys did justice to it, though
      they showed no inclination to linger at the table any longer than was
      absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they sought the quarter-deck, where they spent the afternoon.
      They had now begun to look for the coming of the Antelope with great
      impatience, and their anxiety in this respect kept them in a state of
      suspense which did not allow them to feel interest in any other thing. To
      all of them the time seemed interminable. The spyglass was passed around a
      hundred times, and each one on using it seemed reluctant to give it up.
      But at every fresh survey of the horizon there was the same result; and as
      hour after hour passed, they began to fear that something might have
      happened to Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the time passed. All the afternoon the wind grew higher, and the
      rolling of the vessel increased; still they took tea in the cabin; and
      there arose the important question as to where they should sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinions varied. Some of them, in view of the fact that the wind was
      rather increasing than diminishing, were inclined to desert their
      staterooms, and sleep on the quarter-deck, upon the skylight, under the
      friendly shelter of the tarpaulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom advocated this most strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be just as comfortable,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and much less liable to
      interruption. Here are our mattresses, all spread out, and roomy enough
      for all of us. Here is the tarpaulin hanging over the boom, and making a
      first-rate tent. Down in the cabin the water seems to be slowly
      increasing, and we&rsquo;ll be liable to be washed out of our berths before
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phil, who chimed in with Tom, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s worse, if the sea
      gets rougher, we&rsquo;ll be certain to ship some seas astern before morning,
      and in that case it&rsquo;ll come pouring into the cabin through the skylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it does,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;we should get as wet on the skylight as
      in the cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and we might be washed off into the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we can lash ourselves to the mast, an sleep there,&rdquo; said Pat.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what shipwrecked sailors always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, there&rsquo;s all the difference in the world,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;If we are above,
      we&rsquo;ll be able to avoid any danger, but down below there we&rsquo;ll only be
      drowned like rats in a hole. For my part, if the sea is coming in, I
      should like to be where I can have a chance to swim, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, come now, Tom,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;you are putting it too strong altogether.
      The wind hasn&rsquo;t increased very much, and the change has been very gradual.
      There&rsquo;s no likelihood of any sudden change, you know. If it gets much
      rougher, we&rsquo;ll find it out soon enough, and we&rsquo;ll be able to get out of
      the cabin, I should think, before it gets filled with water. If the ship
      begins to pitch like that, so as to ship heavy seas astern, the first one
      that comes aboard will be enough to wake every mother&rsquo;s son of us. I
      believe in sticking to the cabin as long as we can. Our berths are as
      comfortable as ever. The puddle of water about the floor don&rsquo;t really
      amount to much, after all. The door is so tight now that very little more
      water can get in; and as to shipping seas over the stern, I, for my part,
      don&rsquo;t believe that there is any danger of that just yet; not to-night, at
      any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Just see. After all, there&rsquo;s been no very great change
      since morning. If we were aboard the Antelope, we&rsquo;d think nothing of
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But unfortunately,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not aboard the Antelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Bruce, cheerfully, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t bother ourselves. We&rsquo;re
      pretty certain to be aboard of her to-morrow, if we choose to go, for by
      that time she&rsquo;s sure to show herself. We allowed her three days, and the
      time is up; but we ought to allow one day more in case of unlooked-for
      delays. Perhaps Captain Corbet had to wait for the sails, getting them
      mended, and all that sort of thing. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d wait more than one
      day, at the farthest; so we may look for him tomorrow pretty confidently.
      And in the mean time, I&rsquo;m of Bart&rsquo;s opinion, and think that we&rsquo;d better
      make ourselves comfortable as long as we can, and sleep below until we are
      driven out. I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll be driven out to-night, at any rate; and
      if we are, we&rsquo;ll have plenty of warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The end of it was, that they all decided to sleep below. Solomon, however,
      who had been present at the discussion, informed them that he would sleep
      on deck, and keep one eye open. Some remonstrance was offered, but in
      vain, and at length this arrangement was entered into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the night passed without any accident. Their sleep was
      undisturbed. On waking in the morning, they found not much increase in the
      water inside the cabin, but felt that the vessel was pitching about more
      than ever, and creaking and groaning in every timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying out on deck, they looked eagerly around. Bruce was up first, and
      seizing the spyglass, scanned the whole horizon in the most searching
      manner. But not to the eyes of any one, nor to the searching gaze of
      Bruce, appeared any sail whatever. Not one word was said. The
      disappointment of all amounted almost to dismay for a moment, and their
      feelings were too strong for utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around them the sea arose in foaming billows. Overhead the sky was
      covered with clouds that drove onward impetuously. The wind howled through
      the rigging; the &lsquo;ship labored and plunged, shipping heavy seas, and
      thrusting her bows far under the rolling waves. But the quarter-deck, as
      yet, was spared, and rose above the seas like an island, whereon they
      could rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day passed like the previous one. They spent the whole time looking
      for the Antelope. It was now the fourth day since her departure, and her
      delay made all feel uneasy. The cabin was now too uncomfortable for them,
      so that they decided to eat their meals on the quarter-deck; but Solomon
      cooked their meals in the cabin stove, and struggled heroically against
      fate in the effort to afford his young friends the best fare that could be
      furnished. .
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Antelope!
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time there was no debate about a sleeping-place. No one thought of
      going below, and they all stretched their weary frames on the mattresses,
      which were laid on the skylight.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEIR sleep that night was somewhat
      disturbed, for the novelty of their position prevented them from having
      that placidity of mind which is the best promoter of slumber. At times
      through the night they awaked, and were sensible of the rush of waters
      about the ship&rsquo;s quarter, and also of a greater motion of the vessel,
      accompanied by all manner of creakings and groan-ings. The tarpaulins hung
      over them, having been secured in such a fashion as to form an excellent
      tent, opening towards the stern, and closed at the other end by the
      mizzen-mast and the barrels of biscuit and other things around it. Through
      the opening astern they could see at times, as the ship sunk, the
      phosphorescent gleam of foaming billows rolling around them as if about to
      break over them. Most of these did dash themselves against the ship, but
      none fell upon the quarterdeck; all that the boys felt was the fine spray
      which floated under their resting-place, and saturated everything. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      None of them, however, attempted to rise and go forth until daybreak.
      There was no cause for doing so; their sleeping-place was the most
      comfortable now left in the ship, and the scene without had no attraction
      strong enough to draw them away. Day dawned, and still there was some
      hesitation about getting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day was the fifth since the departure of the Antelope. Their
      situation was now quite serious; but they had not yet seen any signs of
      Captain Corbet. They looked forward towards seeing him on this day, but
      the disappointment of the two previous days made them despondent, and each
      one dreaded to look out, for fear that his forebodings might be confirmed.
      This was the waking thought of each, and each one also perceived that this
      day was worse than any they had known yet. If the Antelope still kept
      away, they scarcely knew what to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they went forth, and looked around. All over the sea the waves
      were larger, and rougher, and fiercer. The motion of the ship was greater
      than ever. It seemed as though the billows, that raced and chased about in
      all directions, were hurrying to overwhelm her. The deck below was all
      covered with white foam, and at times the bows plunged so far under water,
      and remained there so long, and were overwhelmed by such floods of rolling
      billows, that it seemed as though the ship would never again emerge. The
      quarterdeck was now more than ever like an island; but every moment
      lessened its security, and brought it more and more within reach of the
      ravenous waves that surged around on all sides. Such was the sight that
      met their view, as they took their first look around.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all this they had been prepared during the long night, by all that
      they had felt, and heard, and seen; and therefore this did not affect them
      so much. It was the long, eager look which they turned towards the distant
      sea, the sharp, scrutinizing gaze with which they swept the horizon, that
      brought the deepest trouble; for there, over the wide surface of the
      waters, not a single sail was visible; and the fifth day, while it brought
      fresh calamities, brought no Antelope, and no hope of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Pat gave a loud shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;what in the wide wurruld is it that I see over
      there? Sure it&rsquo;s draimin I must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the boys looked in the direction where Pat was pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s land!&rdquo; cried Bruce, in tones of amazement. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo; burst from the other boys, who, with inexpressible wonder, looked
      at the unaccountable sight, and scarcely were able to believe what they
      saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was land&mdash;most unmistakably. There it rose, a long, blue line,
      apparently about fifteen miles away. It was a rugged shore, and extended
      along the horizon for some distance. For such a sight as this they had not
      been in the slightest degree prepared; in fact, they would have expected
      anything sooner; for how could the land move itself up to their
      fast-anchored ship? Yet there was the fact, and before that fact they were
      simply confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;If it had been foggy during
      the last few days, or even hazy, I could then understand it; but it&rsquo;s been
      particularly bright and clear all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it can be something like mirage,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;The mirage never appears, except when the sea is
      perfectly still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;that the ship&rsquo;s been dragging her anchor,
      and has been drifting all these five days; or, at any rate, ever since the
      wind rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she has broken loose,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The chain may have had a weak
      link. I remember the anchor went down with a tremendous jerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half inclined to believe that the anchor
      never got to the bottom. I don&rsquo;t know how deep the water is in the middle
      of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but I remember thinking at the time that it
      was a very short chain to reach to the bottom of the sea. I remember
      wondering that the gulf was so shallow, but I thought that Captain Corbet
      knew what he was about; but now, the more I think of it, the more sure I
      feel that Captain Corbet did <i>not</i> know what he was about, but
      dropped anchor, and let things slide, after his usual careless fashion. He
      confessed, over and over, that he knew nothing at all about these waters;
      and he never once took the trouble to sound, or to try and hunt up a
      chart. No; he has dropped anchor, and the anchor has never begun to get
      near the bottom. The consequence is, we&rsquo;ve been drifting along ever since
      he left us, and are now ever so many miles away from the place where the
      anchor was dropped. And, what&rsquo;s worse, I dare say the Antelope was back
      there two days ago; but we were gone, and so, of course, Captain Corbet&rsquo;s
      lost us, and has no more idea where to look for us than a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil&rsquo;s theory was so plausible, that it was at once accepted by all the
      boys. It seemed the most natural way of accounting for everything,&mdash;for
      the absence of the Antelope, and the appearance of this strange shore. For
      a time a deep gloom fell over all, and they stood in silence, staring at
      the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this gloom Tom was the first to rouse himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, boys,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s
      so bad a thing after all. The more I think of it, the better it seems. I&rsquo;d
      ten times sooner be near some land, as we are now, than be far away out in
      the midst of the sea, with nothing to be seen, day after day, but sky and
      water. It seems to me that we must be drawing nearer to the land, and
      before evening we may be close enough to see what sort of a country it is.
      If the worst comes to the worst, we can launch the boat, and go ashore.
      It&rsquo;s a little rough, but, after all, not too rough for the boat. I&rsquo;ve been
      out in an open boat when the water was quite as rough as this. It seems
      rough to us, because the ship is water-logged, and is drifting every way&mdash;end
      on, side on, and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what land it is,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we only knew how the wind has been, we might guess how we have been
      drifting,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;but the wind has changed once or twice, and I&rsquo;ve
      never kept any account of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;it has been blowing from the bows, and sometimes
      from the quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, of course, and every other way,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;for the simple reason
      that the ship must have been turning about, first one way and then the
      other, as she drifted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a strong idea,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;that this land is Newfoundland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;my impression is, that it&rsquo;s Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island.
      For this to be Newfoundland, the wind should have been from the south or
      the south-west; but it seems to me that it has been generally from a
      northerly direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything of the kind,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s been from a
      westerly direction, and that this is some part of Nova Scotia or Cape
      Breton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, an I agree with Tom,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;about the wind, only I don&rsquo;t think
      that this is Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island; it&rsquo;s too high&mdash;so it is&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s meself that wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if it should turrun out to be
      the Magdalen Islands after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too long in extent for the Magdalen Islands. I
      think it may be some part of the New Brunswick coast, perhaps Miramichi,&mdash;for
      it seems to me that the wind has generally come from the east.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seems to me,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;but, Bruce, an east wind couldn&rsquo;t take
      us to Miramichi; it would bring us a good distance to the north of that,
      from the place where we were. It seems to me that this must be Gaspé,&mdash;and
      if so, we won&rsquo;t be very far away from the Bay de Chaleur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; cried Pat, with a laugh, &ldquo;sure it&rsquo;s the whole surroundin
      coasts that we&rsquo;ve gone over, so it is, an every one of us has put her in a
      different place from every one else. One comfort is, that some of us&rsquo;ll
      have to be right, an so I&rsquo;ll stick, so I will, to the Magdalen Islands, an
      if it is, why sure we&rsquo;re certain of good intertainment, so we are, ivery
      one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, cheerily, &ldquo;perhaps, after all, this is about the
      best thing that could have happened to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know the very reason that Captain Corbet went away was to get
      sails to bring this ship to some land. The very thing we all wanted was to
      get her to some land. Well, here we&rsquo;ve been drifting along, and now, lo
      and behold! here is the land that we wanted to reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but how can we get her to any port? We&rsquo;ve got no sails, and we can&rsquo;t
      steer her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, when we get nearer, some pilots or fishermen will come off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but will they be salvors too?&rdquo; asked Phil, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Bruce, in a lofty tone; &ldquo;they shall be nothing of
      the kind. We&rsquo;ll hire them to help us bring her into port. We&rsquo;ll pay them
      liberally, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t let Captain Corbet&rsquo;s absence make any
      difference. He shall have his share all the same&mdash;for his not being
      here isn&rsquo;t his fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea is,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;d better make a contribution, call it
      the Corbet Baby Fund, and add it to his share for the sake of old times,
      and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our profits,&rdquo; Bruce went on to say, in the same lofty tone, &ldquo;will depend
      very largely upon the sort of place we can bring the ship to. If this is
      Miramichi, they ought to be very large,&mdash;in fact, the ship&rsquo;ll bring
      as large a price there as anywhere; but if it&rsquo;s the Magdalen Islands, why,
      of course we can&rsquo;t expect to do quite so well. Still we ought to do well
      in almost any case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know how we can get word to Captain Corbet again,&rdquo; said
      Arthur. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll feel anxious about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;On landing, we can telegraph to the
      Magdalen Islands, and they&rsquo;ll get word to him somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any cable to the Magdalen Islands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the Newfoundland cable pass by there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, we&rsquo;ll telegraph to various places, and he&rsquo;ll be sure to hear
      sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s become of him?&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he&rsquo;s cruising about the gulf everywhere, asking every vessel
      he meets about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope, then, he&rsquo;ll meet with more vessels than we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very curious thing that we haven&rsquo;t seen any vessels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I suppose we&rsquo;ve drifted out of the way of the fishing vessels and the
      timber ships. I dare say the fishing vessels keep generally to the same
      places, for fishes must be more abundant in some spots than in others,
      and, as to the timber ships, they try to keep as much as possible in one
      given course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether we&rsquo;re drifting towards that land, or past it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, we didn&rsquo;t see it yesterday, and we do see it to-day, which
      proves that we have drifted towards it during the night; and from this it
      follows that we will be likely to continue drifting towards it. When we
      get pretty close we must contrive to get some of the fishermen on the
      coast to help us; but I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;ll be any trouble about that.
      They&rsquo;ll all come piling on board as soon as they catch sight of us, and
      see our situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what sort of people they are,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;Along some of these
      shores they don&rsquo;t bear the best of characters. Some of the fishing
      population are given to wrecking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of that,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;and I never did. I dare say
      if a ship breaks up they appropriate what they can in a quiet way, and
      when the owners appear, they may be rather loath to surrender their spoil;
      but wrecking, in its bad sense, is not known here on these shores.
      Wrecking, as I understand it, means decoying vessels ashore, and sometimes
      murdering the shipwrecked crews. And I never heard of a case of that kind
      about these waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Bart, &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t feel inclined to recognize our
      ownership. I confess I don&rsquo;t feel myself a very strong confidence in our
      claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know. The claim don&rsquo;t seem to be a just one; for instance,
      now, if the owners were to appear in a steam-tug and hitch on, would you
      order them off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; said Bruce, firmly; &ldquo;of course I would. I would hire them
      to tow our ship and cargo into port, and pay them liberally, of course;
      but as to recognizing them as being owners, so long as we, the salvors,
      were on board, I would do nothing of the kind. The moment the captain and
      crew deserted the Petrel, that moment they lost all claims to her, on
      their own account and on account of their employers. The owners after that
      must look to the insurance companies, while we gain the benefits of good
      fortune and our own boldness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bruce spoke all this in the most cool and confident manner in the world,
      and in the same tone as though the Petrel was lying in some safe harbor,
      and he and the boys were contemplating her, and considering her from a
      cosy nook on the wharf. Yet all the time the ship was pitching, and
      tossing, and straining, and the waves boiled around, and the seas rolled
      in foam over her deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was at length interrupted by Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head and shoulders were projecting from the skylight. He was standing
      on the cabin table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ise ben a tryin, chilen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an a deav-orin to git up some kine ob
      a fire down heah, but I ben an made it six or seben times, an ebery time
      de water hab stinguished it. Don know dat dar&rsquo;s any sort o&rsquo; use in tryin
      to kin&rsquo;l it agin, specially as all de kinlin wood&rsquo;s used up, an de res ob
      it is soaked through an through. Pears to me we&rsquo;ll hab to do widout de tea
      an coffee, an drink cole water dis time, unless we can manage to hist dis
      yer stove on deck. Only, if we do, it might turn out to be a leetle mite
      tottlish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;what do you say? Shall we try and get the stove
      on deck, or drink cold water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stove on deck? O, nonsense!&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the odds if we
      don&rsquo;t have tea and coffee? We&rsquo;ve got enough to eat; we&rsquo;ve got a precious
      sight better supply than we ever had on board the Antelope&mdash;cold
      boiled ham, mustard, biscuit, butter, cheese, potted meats, and no end of
      things. Bother the stove, I say. Let it slide. What do we want with it up
      here? We never could fix it in a tight place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the decision of all. In fact all saw that any attempt to hoist up
      the stove would have been absurd. The ship was pitching and tossing too
      much to make such a task practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Solomon came forth, having been driven from the cabin, as he had
      formerly been driven from the cook&rsquo;s galley; but not for this did he lose
      any of his equanimity. He proceeded to lay out the breakfast as well as he
      could upon the skylight, piling up the mattresses in a dry place, and
      laying the table with a regard rather to use than to show. He tacitly
      assumed that under the circumstances the breakfast would be somewhat
      informal, and did not think it necessary to risk plates and cups by
      putting them where they would be certain to be flung off by the motion of
      the ship. The table was therefore rudely spread, but the eatables were all
      that could be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the day went on, and the boys watched hour after hour the
      distant shore. By midday it had grown much more distinct, and they knew
      that they were drawing nearer. A few hours after they had drawn still
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the nearer they came the less satisfaction did they feel in the aspect
      of the land. The most careful examination through the glass failed to show
      the slightest sign of life. No houses appeared, no tilled fields, no
      pastures even, no clearings of any kind; but a rocky shore, with a wooded
      country behind, was all that they could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;this is the way it is almost everywhere
      around these coasts; but I dare say Miramichi settlement is only a few
      miles away, and we may find a fisherman&rsquo;s hut in some cove close by.&rdquo;

      through that day the sea continued as rough as at first, and the wind blew
      as strongly. In the afternoon the wind came up more fiercely, and far
      surpassed anything they had experienced since they had boarded the Petrel.
      It sang and roared through the rigging, and so great was its power, that
      there was a perceptible list in the ship in spite of the tremendous weight
      of her cargo and water-logged hull. Soon the increasing wind stirred up
      the sea to greater fury, and the ship began to labor most fearfully. Every
      hour made it worse; and at length the whole ship forward seemed to be
      perpetually submerged, for nothing could be seen of its deck, and the
      foaming waves rolled backward and forward, and boiled, and seethed, and
      swept resistlessly to and fro. Sometimes a dozen huge waves in succession
      broke in thunder on the helpless ship which lay beneath them, and received
      these mountain torrents, quivering and groaning in every plank and beam.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the boys had certainly become accustomed to the creaking and
      groaning of the straining ship, but this surpassed all that they had yet
      seen, and filled them with awe. They stood there looking at the scene; the
      land was now forgotten. It had lost its interest. The feeling began to
      arise that perhaps they might never reach those shores, and if they did
      turn a glance any longer in that direction, it was solely in order to
      measure the intervening distance, and try whether it might be possible for
      the ship to reach the shore before going to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon alone stood unmoved. Faithful to the last, with his one idea, the
      performance of his duty, Solomon prepared the evening meal. The cook
      triumphed over the man, and professional feeling rose superior to the
      frailties of humanity. It was ham that they would have, and biscuit, and
      butter. They should have cheese, too, and sardines. Pickles and mustard
      should not be wanting. And Solomon laid these on the skylight, one by one,
      solemnly and in silence, as though the consciousness was present in his
      breast that this meal might be the last on board. Never before had he
      arranged a repast more deliberately and more thoughtfully. The table was
      set under circumstances which, indeed, required deliberation and thought.
      The pitching of the ship was so violent, that it required the most careful
      management to induce the things to lie in their places; and it was only by
      covering the biscuit with bits of board, that he succeeded in keeping them
      to their places. With the ham he had a long struggle, but finally tied it
      with rope-yarn to the skylight. As to the smaller articles, he had to
      leave them in the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon was just returning for the last time, carrying a piece of cheese
      and a box of sardines; the boys were seated on the edge of the skylight,
      waiting for the preparations to be completed, when suddenly the stern of
      the ship went down, down, down, very much farther than they had ever known
      it to descend before. An awful thought seized upon all: the ship was
      sinking! Every one started wildly up, clutching at anything that happened
      to be nearest, without knowing what they were doing, and looking fearfully
      through the opening at the end of their shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrific sight that appeared in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There rose a wall of water, black, towering high in wrathful menace, with
      its crest boiling in white foam. For a few moments that great mass hung
      poised above them; and then, with terrific fury, and with resistless
      might, it descended in thunder upon them. For a few moments all was the
      blackness of darkness, and the boys struggled despairingly with the
      rolling, overwhelming, foaming waters, which swept them helplessly about.
      The thought, and the only thought in every mind, was, that the ship was
      going down, and with this conviction that the last hour of life had come,
      there rose from each a short prayer, gasped out in that moment of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed ages; but at length the ship slowly struggled up, and the waters
      rolled away. For a few moments they all lay where they had been thrown,
      heaped up together; and then they struggled to their feet, and each began
      to call after the others. To their great joy they found that they all were
      there, and that, except a few bruises more or less severe, no evil had
      been incurred. But the tarpaulins had been torn from the fastenings, and
      blown away by the fury of the wind, and the boys had been saved from a
      similar fate only by the quarter-deck rail, against which they had been
      flung. To this rail they clung as they rose to their feet, and for a short
      time stood clinging there, not knowing what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from this stupor they were roused by the voice of Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chilen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;de suppa am &rsquo;sposed of, an you got to go widout
      it dis bressed night. No use settin de table agin. Don&rsquo;t pay in dis yer
      weather. Anybody dat wants anytin to eat, had bes go to de barl or de
      trunk an fish for hisself. Dere all full ob salt water, and dem dat&rsquo;s fond
      ob salt junk can get deir fill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None of the boys, however, showed any disposition to eat. This last wave
      had destroyed all appetite. It had showed them how the wind had increased.
      They had hoped all along that the quarter-deck would be spared, and that
      they would be safe there; but now this hope was lost: where one wave had
      come, others were sure to follow, and the prospects for the night were
      dark and dismal indeed. For the night was before them. The sun was already
      going down; the sky looked lowering, and dark, and menacing; the wind had
      grown to a gale, and all around the waters seemed waiting to ingulf them.
      Once they had wondered why the captain and crew had fled from the ship;
      now they understood but too well the reason of that flight. The idea of
      salvage seemed now to all of them a miserable mockery. What would they not
      have given to have escaped from this ship to any place of safety? Even the
      days of famine on board the Antelope seemed less terrible than the fate
      that now frowned wrathfully upon them out of the lowering night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to stay here,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Another wave&rsquo;ll follow. Let&rsquo;s get
      higher up, out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we go?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in the rigging,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; Saying this, he climbed up the
      mizzen shrouds for a little distance on the windward side. The others
      followed. Last of all came Solomon, who took up his station below them all
      as though to guard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      There they all clung, and watched with awful eyes the scene below. It
      seemed for some time as though they had been premature in deserting the
      quarter-deck, for no wave followed that mountain billow which had
      precipitated itself upon them. But the recollection of that one wave was
      enough; and though its successor came not for some time, still they all
      confidently expected it. They knew that it would come before long,
      followed by many others, for the sea grew higher every minute, and the
      wrath of its waters grew more wild. Forward all was a sea of foam, and the
      quarter-deck appeared beneath them like a raft over which they hung as
      they clung to the shrouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not climb far up. They were not more than ten feet above the
      deck, having rested at this point, so that they might be out of the reach
      of the waves and no more. About their lost repast they did not think for
      one moment. That wave which had swept away their supper, had carried with
      it all thoughts and all desires concerning it. The only one who gave it a
      thought was Solomon, who, even now, was still true to his professional
      duties; and seeing the boiled ham lying against the quarter-deck railing,
      in the very place where it had been flung, he leaped down, at the peril of
      his life, hastily seized it, pitched it into the trunk, and then clambered
      back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boun to skewer dat ar ham dis yer time,&rdquo; said he, in a soliloquizing
      tone. &ldquo;No use lettin de win an de sea hab it all deir own way, nohow. Dat
      ar ham&rsquo;s too precious to be lost, an I&rsquo;se boun to&rsquo; serve it up yet for
      breakfus to-morrow, when de storm goes down. Lucky we didn&rsquo;t try to hist
      up dat ar cabin stove. Jerusalem! wouldn&rsquo;t it hab spun overboard? Would
      so. But it&rsquo;s down deep &rsquo;nough now in de water, for de cabin&rsquo;s chock
      full. Don&rsquo;t ebber &rsquo;member bein so &rsquo;sturbed before in all my
      cookin &rsquo;sperience; an watebbers goin to be de suit ob it all&rsquo;s
      more&rsquo;n I can tell. Beats all; an dese yer chilen&rsquo;s all boun to catch deir
      deff ob cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Solomon raised his head, and looked at each one of the boys in
      succession. He saw them all wet to the skin, with the water dripping from
      their clothes, and their hands clutching fast the rigging. It was a
      painful sight, too painful: he turned away his face, and drops of brine
      ran down his face which did not come from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a thunderous sound arose, which made every one look in terror
      towards the place from which it came. It was forward. In an instant they
      saw it all. Several great waves had fallen there in swift succession,
      striking amidships full upon a round-house which stood there, and was used
      for the reception of deck cargoes. The force of these blows was
      resistless; the structure yielded with a crash, and gave way utterly. For
      a moment it was brought up against the ship&rsquo;s bulwarks, but the waters
      poured in underneath, floated it far upward, and tumbled it over into the
      sea. There it floated at the mercy of the waves, farther and farther away,
      while the raging billows, like hungry wolves, éncompassed it on every
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys had already felt sufficiently awed by the scene around to be.
      hushed into silence, but about this last event there was something so
      appalling that they all uttered an involuntary cry, and clung more closely
      to the rigging, each one looking at his neighbor with a face of despair.
      For the only thought now present to each one was, that the ship was
      breaking up, and that utter ruin and destruction was imminent. The crash
      of the wave, as it struck the massive structure and tore it away, was so
      tremendous that the boys might well have dreaded the worst; and the sight
      of it now, as it tossed and tumbled in the boiling floods, had in it
      something so terribly suggestive of their own fate, that they shuddered
      and turned their eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly Solomon&rsquo;s voice broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;dar&rsquo;s how I knowed it was goin for to be. I bet high on
      de cook&rsquo;s galley. Dem dar round-houses only built for show; dey got no
      rail strenf. Now de cook&rsquo;s galley down dar ain&rsquo;t goin to gib way dat
      fashium; she&rsquo;s boun to stan, jes like de rock ob Gibberalter, an de stove
      too,&mdash;dat&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Solomon&rsquo;s tone which was so cool and matter-of-fact
      that the others felt a little reassured, and recovered a little of their
      former coolness. They saw that the ship was still holding together, and as
      the waves rolled back, they saw the smooth firm deck where the roundhouse
      had stood, and learned from this that the round-house did not constitute a
      portion of the ship, but was merely an erection on that deck, and
      therefore to some extent a movable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Solomon&rsquo;s confidence in the cook&rsquo;s galley was by no means warranted by
      facts. Thus far it had been protected to some extent from the sweep of the
      waves by the round-house, and the loss of this barrier left it all exposed
      to the full fury of the waters. For some time it bore up gallantly, and as
      each wave rolled over it, Solomon cheered exultantly, to see it come forth
      erect from the rolling torrents. At length, however, Solomon&rsquo;s exultant
      cries grew fainter, and finally ceased altogether. For the galley was
      shaking, and quivering, and yielding. At length one side started, and was
      beaten out; the rest soon followed, until all was crushed to fragments,
      and its separate portion hurled out upon the angry sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; said Solomon, &ldquo;dat ar galley held out pooty tough, mind I tell
      you; an dar&rsquo;s de stove yet, as large as life, an it&rsquo;s goin to take a good
      many waves afore they&rsquo;ll be able to start her. Yes, dat ar stove&rsquo;s goin to
      hold on, mind I tell you; an I&rsquo;se a goin to bile a kittle ob water on her
      yet, you see. Will so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Solomon really meant what he said, is an open question. He may
      have really believed it all, or, as is most probable, he may have
      expressed himself in this way merely for the purpose of giving courage and
      confidence to the boys, and preventing them from sinking into despair.
      Certain it is that his words had this effect; and seeing that the loss of
      the round-house and galley had made no material difference in the ship
      herself, they clung to hope, and tried to believe that the stout hull,
      with its firm cargo, would ride out the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time the sun had set; and now, in addition to their other
      troubles, there was added the dismal prospect of the coming night. Dark,
      indeed, would that night be to all of them. Fearful enough was their
      position already; but when, in addition to this, they would find the light
      of day cut off, and the horror of great darkness all around, what support
      could they find for their sinking souls, or what hope of escape? Already
      the land was fading out of sight, lost in the gathering shadows of
      evening. By the dim twilight they could see that they had drawn much
      nearer, and their distance seemed now but a few miles. Thus far they had
      regarded the land only with pleasure; now, however, as the night came
      down, and the darkness deepened, and the storm increased, they began to
      experience other feelings with regard to this dreary shore. That it was
      rocky and forbidding they had already seen, nor had they hitherto been
      able to detect any part of the coast here which was at all inviting or
      favorable to a landing. If in such a storm the ship should be driven upon
      such a shore, what could save her from being shattered to pieces? If in
      such a darkness they were driven upon those rocks, what could save them
      from destruction? Yet towards that unknown shore they were every moment
      drawing nearer, and wind and tide seemed alike to urge them onward towards
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet dark, when suddenly a giant wave rose high from underneath
      the stern, and hung suspended over the quarter-deck. It was the
      counterpart of that wave which had struck them an hour before. For a few
      moments it hung, poised and quivering, and then it fell, in thunder, down.
      It poured all over the barrels of biscuit that were lashed to the
      mizzen-mast, it swept down through the skylight into the cabin, it rolled
      in a flood over the deck, and rushed forward, pouring down, and blending
      its waters with those that boiled and foamed amidships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship now seemed unable to rise. She seemed to have sunk into some
      vortex, and being without anything like buoyancy, the waters held her
      fast. Wave after wave rolled in, and poured over the quarter-deck. The
      whole ship, from stem to stern, seemed to be one mass of foam. The hull
      was lost to sight. They seemed supported by masts that rose out of the
      sea. Destruction appeared close at hand. Clinging to the rigging with
      death-like tenacity, they could only murmur their prayers of despair to
      that mighty unseen Being who holds the waters in the hollow of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, shuddering, and groaning, and trembling in every fibre, like
      some living thing, the ship struggled up out of the mass of waters, and
      freed herself for a time. The boys could see the quarter-deck. They could
      see the barrels lashed to the mizzen-mast still secure. They breathed more
      freely. It seemed as though they had received a reprieve,&mdash;as though
      their despairing cries had been heard and answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t hang here all night. We&rsquo;ll fall off. Lets go
      up higher. There&rsquo;s room for all of us, I think, in the mizzen-top. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he started upward. The rest followed. Solomon went up
      last. They all reached the mizzen-top in safety, and, on reaching it,
      found that it was spacious enough to afford room for them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Pat proceeded to possess himself of a line which ran through a block
      close by, after which he began to tie himself to the mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you up to, Pat?&rdquo; asked Bart, in some wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s tying meself to the mast, I am, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tying yourself to the mast?&rdquo; repeated Bart, in amazement. &ldquo;What in the
      world is that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it for?&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Sure and what else is it that people always
      do in shipwrecks? It&rsquo;s the reg&rsquo;lar thing, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have my hands free. If this
      mast should go over, I&rsquo;d rather not be fastened to it as tight as that.
      You&rsquo;d better not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an won&rsquo;t I float ashore on it without any trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; only the trouble may be to keep your head above water. Don&rsquo;t do it,
      Pat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Pat was deaf to argument. Slowly, but pertinaciously and securely, he
      wound the rope round and round the mast, binding himself to it tighter at
      every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d best follow my lade,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough left in this bit of
      a line to tie ye&rsquo;s all fast and firrum, so there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the others refused. They preferred liberty of action, and did not like
      the idea of swathing themselves up like mummies. They wished to be able
      occasionally, if possible, to lie down, or sit down, and not remain all
      night on their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus there they stood in the mizzen-top. And the night came down, and the
      darkness gathered deeper and deeper around them. And the storm rose to its
      height, and night, and storm, and darkness, in all their terrific power,
      environed them as they stood in their giddy perch.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>IGHT, and storm, and darkness! There, in
      their giddy perch in the mizzen-top, stood that despairing little band.
      Gradually all the scene was lost to view in thick darkness. But beneath,
      the ship tossed and pitched wildly, groaning and creaking as before, and
      the big waves beat in fury on her bows, or fell in thunder on her
      quarter-deck. Looking down, they saw the phosphorescent gleam of the
      boiling waters, which made all the extent of the ship luminous with a
      baleful lustre, and wide over the seas extended the same glow. Well it was
      for them that they had sought this place of retreat, or rather that this
      place of retreat had been left open to them, for clinging to the rigging
      would have exhausted their strength, and through those long hours more
      than one might have fallen into the sea. But as it was they could have
      something like rest, and, by changing their positions, find relief for
      their wearied frames. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this place had its own terrors, which were fully equal to any others.
      The wind howled fearfully through the rigging, and as the ship pitched and
      tossed, the mast strained and quivered in unison. Often and often it
      seemed to them that the strained mast would suddenly snap and go over the
      side, or, if not, that in its violent jerks it might hurl them all over to
      destruction. More than once they thought of guarding against this last
      danger by following Pat&rsquo;s example, and binding themselves to the rigging;
      but they were deterred from this by the fear of the mast falling, in which
      case they, too, would be helpless. Fortunate it was for them that there
      were no sails. These had long since been rent away; but had they been here
      now, or had the wind taken any stronger hold of the masts, they must have
      gone by the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often and often, as some larger wave than usual struck the ship, the
      feeling came that all was over, and that now, at last, her break-up was
      beginning; often and often, as she sank far down, and the waters rolled
      over her quarter, and held her there, the fear came to them that at last
      her hour had come&mdash;that she was sinking; and with this fear they
      looked down, expecting to see the waters rise to where they were standing.
      And then, in every one of these moments of deadly fear, they raised, as
      before, their cries to Him who is able to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed away hour after hour, until the duration of time seemed endless,
      and it was to all of them as though they had spent days in their place of
      peril, instead of hours only.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they became sensible of a diminution in the power of the wind.
      At first they hardly dared to believe it, but after a time it became fully
      evident that such was the case. The cessation of the wind at once relieved
      the ship very materially, though the sea was still high, and the waters
      below relaxed but little from their rage. But the cessation of the wind
      filled them all with hope, and they now awaited, with something like
      firmness, the subsidence of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      That subsidence did come, and was gradually evident. It was slow, yet it
      was perceptible. They first became aware that those giant waves no longer
      fell in thunder upon the quarter-deck, and that the ship no longer seemed
      to be dragged down into those deep, watery abysses into which they had
      formerly seemed to be descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake about it, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce at length, in tones that
      were tremulous with fervent joy; &ldquo;the storm is going down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first word that had been spoken for hours, and the sound of
      these spoken words itself brought joy to all hearts. The spell was broken.
      The horror vanished utterly from their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Bart, in tones as tremulous as those of Bruce, and from the
      same cause,&mdash;&ldquo;yes, the worst is over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind this pitching,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;it seems familiar. I think
      to-night has been equal to my night in the Bay of Fundy&mdash;only it
      hasn&rsquo;t been so long, and it&rsquo;s seemed better to have you fellows with me
      than being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a hard time in the woods,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;but this has been quite
      equal to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been doing the mummy long enough. You&rsquo;d better
      untie now, and lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s meself that&rsquo;ll be the proud lad to do that same,&rdquo; said Pat,
      &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s fairly achin I am all over, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Pat tried to unbind himself. But this was not so easy. He
      had been leaning his whole weight against the ropes, and his hands were
      quite numb. The other boys had to help him. This was a work of some
      difficulty, but it was accomplished at last, and poor Pat sank down
      groaning, and he never ceased to sigh and groan till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several hours now passed. The sea subsided steadily, until at length its
      motion was comparatively trifling, not more than enough to cause a
      perpendicular pitch to the ship of a few feet, and to send a few waves
      occasionally over the deck. Wearied and worn out, the boys determined to
      descend to the quarter-deck, so as to lie down. Pat was unable to make the
      descent; so Bart remained with him, and curled himself up alongside of him
      on the mizzen-top. The other boys went down, and Solomon also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything there was wet, but as the boys also were saturated, it made but
      little difference. They flung themselves down anywhere, and soon were fast
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the main-top Pat was groaning in his pain. The blood was rushing
      back into his benumbed limbs, and causing exquisite suffering. Bart tried
      to soothe him, and rubbed and chafed his arms and hands and feet and legs
      for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Pat grew easier, though still suffering somewhat from pricking
      sensations in his arms and legs, and Bart was allowed to rest from his
      labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as Bart leaned back, he became aware of a very peculiar sound,
      which excited all his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a droning sound, with a deep, swelling cadence, and not long in
      duration; but it rose, and pealed forth, and died away, to be followed by
      other sounds precisely similar&mdash;regular, recurrent, and sounding all
      abroad. It was nothing like the roar of the waves, nor the singing of the
      wind through the rigging; it was something different from these, yet in
      this darkness, and to this listener, not less terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart knew it. The sound was familiar to his ears. There was only one sound
      in Nature of that character, nor could it be imitated by any other. It was
      the long sound of the surf falling upon the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surf!
    </p>
    <p>
      What did that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      It meant that land was near. And what land?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one land that this could tell of&mdash;it was that land
      which they had been approaching for days; the land which they had watched
      so closely all the previous day, and to which at evening they had been
      drawn so near. The name of the land he could not know, but he had seen it,
      and he remembered its drear and desolate aspect, its iron-bound shores,
      its desert forests. It was upon this shore that the surf was beating which
      now he heard, and the loudness of that sound told him how near it must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that it could not be more than half a mile away at the
      farthest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the ship was drifting on!
    </p>
    <p>
      This first discovery was a renewal of his despair. He could only find
      comfort in the thought that the sea had subsided so greatly. What ought he
      now to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ought he to awake the boys and tell them? He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat had by this time fallen asleep, worn out with weariness and pain. Bart
      had not the heart to wake him just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was an opening in the sky overhead, and through a rift in
      the clouds the moon beamed forth. Bart started up and looked all around.
      The morn disclosed the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea had grown much calmer, and the waves that now tossed about their
      spray over its surface were as nothing compared to those which had beat
      upon the ship during the night. This was probably due, as Bart thought, to
      the shelter of some headland which acted as a breakwater. For as he looked
      he saw the land now full before him. He had conjectured rightly from the
      sound of the surf, and he now saw that this land could not be much more
      than a half mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confirmation of his worst fears overcame him. He started to his feet,
      and stood clinging to the rigging, and looking at the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      How near! how fearfully near! And every moment was drawing the ship
      nearer. And what sort of a shore was that? Was it all rocky, or was it
      smooth sand? The waves were high enough there to create a tremendous surf.
      Did that surf fall on breakers, or did it fall on some gentle beach? This
      he could not tell. In vain he strained his eyes. He could see the white
      line of foaming surf, and beyond this the dark hills, or cliffs, but more
      than this he could make out nothing definite. But the shore was so near
      that their fate could not be very long delayed, and he determined to wake
      the boys at once, leaving Pat to sleep a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this intention he prepared to descend. But scarce had he put one foot
      over, when he saw a shadowy figure close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas&rsquo;r Bart,&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you a movin about, an I jes thought I&rsquo;d come up to see how you was
      a gittin along,&rdquo; said Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the land?&rdquo; asked Bart, in agitated tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De lan! Sartin sure&mdash;seen it dese four hours. Ben a watchin it ebber
      so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Why didn&rsquo;t you wake us before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake you? Not me. What de use ob dat ar? I ben kine o&rsquo; watchin, an kine
      o&rsquo; canterin round all de time, seein dat de tings are all straight; an I
      got de galley stove in prime order, an if youns don&rsquo;t get de bes breakfas
      you ebber eat, den I&rsquo;m a useless ole nigga. Sho, now; go away. Leab tings
      to me, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast!&rdquo; cried Bart, in amazement. &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll drift ashore in a few
      minutes. Don&rsquo;t you see how near we are? What shall we do? Is the boat
      gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon put his head back for a few minutes, and chuckled to himself in a
      kind of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De boat? O, yes, de boat&rsquo;s all right. Held on tight as a drum&mdash;de
      boat an de galley stove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, then,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;come, let&rsquo;s wake the boys, and get her out at once.
      It isn&rsquo;t too rough for her here. We must get some pieces of wood for
      paddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, dere&rsquo;s lashins ob time; neber you mind,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;You jes lie
      down an finish your nap, an leab de res to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re drifting ashore. In a quarter of an hour we&rsquo;ll be among the
      breakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no, Mas&rsquo;r Bart; not in a good many quarter ob an hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the shore&rsquo;s only half a mile away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Solomon; &ldquo;an it&rsquo;s ben jes dat, ar distums off for de las
      four hour an more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s so. I ben a watchin. Hadn&rsquo;t I tole you dat ar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the ship&rsquo;s afloat. She isn&rsquo;t aground. She must be drifting in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat ar conclusium don&rsquo;t foller as a nessary suc-cumstance,&rdquo; said Solomon,
      with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what prevents her from drifting?&rdquo; asked Bart, in a puzzle..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De simplest ting in de world,&rdquo; said Solomon&mdash;&ldquo;her anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her anchor! O,&rdquo; cried Bart, as a flood of light burst in upon his mind,
      and dispelled all the darkness of his despair; &ldquo;her anchor! O, I begin to
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said Solomon; &ldquo;when I fust heard dat ar surf I was in a
      quandary, mind I tell you. Gib all up. Was jes about to rouse youns. But
      fust an foremost I went to see about de boat. Found dat all right an
      tight. Den I got a belayum pin an tored off some strips ob wood for
      paddles. Den I waited to see how we was a goin. Well, arter waitin for
      ebber so long, de surf didn&rsquo;t get any nearer. Tell you what; dat ar
      succumstance puzzled dis old nigga&rsquo;s head considdable. Sudden a idee
      popped into me. I ran forad, an sure enough I found de ship&rsquo;s head off
      from de sho, an felt de anchor chain standin out stiff. Den I knew de
      anchor had caught, and had fetched her up all right in dis yer identicull
      place an po&mdash;sitium; an so, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, here we air, anchored hard an
      fast, de boat all right an tight, de paddles ready, de galley stove ready
      too, an de prospek afore all ob us ob a fus&rsquo;-rate breakfas to ward us for
      all de per&rsquo;ls an clamties ob de night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some further inquiries followed from Bart, which served to assure him
      still more of Solomon&rsquo;s vigilance; and the result was, that after a time
      he resumed his place beside Pat in the mizzen-top, and, curling himself
      up, was soon sound asleep. It was not a very luxurious sleeping-place, but
      it was at least as soft as the deck below, where the boys had flung
      themselves, and it was also a trifle dryer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bart awoke it was broad day. Pat was gone. He had awaked, and,
      finding himself all right again, and seeing the land close by, he had
      descended to the deck to talk to Solomon. For his first thought had been a
      very natural one, namely, that the ship was going ashore; and seeing
      Solomon placidly moving about below, he had gone down to find out what it
      all meant. Of course his fears were soon dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the boys waked at about the same time that Bart did, and he
      soon rejoined them below. The smell of broiled ham was wafted over the
      ship. Great was the wonder of Bruce, Arthur, Tom, and Phil at their
      present situation, and even greater was their wonder at seeing the repast
      which Solomon had already spread out upon the quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Solomon had been working like a beaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forced open the cabin door, and let out all the water. He had then
      obtained some coal, which, though wet, burned merrily in the galley stove,
      and had found the cooking utensils, which he had fortunately conveyed to
      the cabin when he had first been driven from the galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biscuit were, of course, soaked and saturated with salt water; but
      Solomon declared that they were made to be soaked before cooking, and that
      the salt water was &ldquo;jes as good as fresh&mdash;ebry mite.&rdquo; So he fried
      these in butter, and sprinkled over them some pepper, which was in the
      sea-chest, and which, with all the other contents of the chest, had not
      been injured. Ham, and toasted cheese, and potted meats, and tea and
      coffee, together with other articles too numerous to mention, formed the
      breakfast; and it is scarce necessary to say that the boys did full
      justice to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast they began to consider what next they should do. The land
      was close by, about half a mile away. The line of coast extended far away
      towards the left, but on the right it ended in a headland. The sea was
      very quiet, but on the shore before them there was a heavy surf, the
      result of the past storm. They saw farther away to the left a smooth
      beach, where a landing might be easily effected, and another place towards
      the right where there was very little surf. This last seemed the best
      place for attempting a landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shore was not very attractive. In some places rocky cliffs arose,
      crowned at the summit with spruce and birch; in other places there were
      slopes covered with the same sort of trees. There was no sign whatever of
      any house, or of any cultivation, or of any pasture land, or of any
      clearing. The forest seemed unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were now as ignorant of the country as they had been when they
      first saw it. Each still held the same opinion which he had announced
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phil thought that it was Newfoundland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, that it was Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart, that it was some part of Nova Scotia, or Cape Breton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat, that it was the Magdalen Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce, that it was the coast of New Brunswick, somewhere near the
      Miramichi.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Arthur, that it was Gaspé, not far from the Bay de Chaleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, although this particular spot seemed desolate enough, no one gave
      any thought to that, for they all supposed that inhabitants could be found
      within no very great distance. .
    </p>
    <p>
      After some deliberation, it was at length concluded to go ashore. The
      strips of wood which Solomon had already, with wise forethought, procured,
      were easily shaped into very respectable paddles by means of a hatchet and
      a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then determined to secure themselves from want while ashore, and this
      they did by putting into the boat one of the barrels of biscuit and the
      chest of provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all embarked and pulled away. They paddled along without
      difficulty towards the beach on the right, where the surf seemed less. On
      approaching this, they found a cove formed by a gully among the hills, and
      at one end there were grassy banks, near which a stream of fresh water
      flowed into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they landed.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>aptain Corbet had arrived at the place
      where he supposed he had left the Petrel, and on looking about saw no
      signs of her, he was filled with despair. The wind had been blowing all
      night long, and the sea had been rising to an extent that might have
      justified the deepest anxiety; he had been upheld only by the thought that
      he was bringing relief to the boys; and this solitary consolation was
      taken from him by the first glance that he cast around. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the fifth day since he had left them. He had gone, proposing and
      expecting to be back in two days, or in three at farthest. But he had gone
      much farther than he had at first intended, and hence had left them longer
      than he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And where were they now?
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain he strained his eyes. The only sail on the water was that
      schooner: possibly some fisherman cruising about in this direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys that had been committed to his care,&mdash;the boys
      who had been intrusted to him,&mdash;the boys who had confided in him,&mdash;the
      boys who had placed their young lives in his keeping?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys whom he had left; whom he had promised to return for
      so promptly?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had led them into difficulty, and left them there!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had led them into starvation&mdash;that was his first fault. How they
      had suffered during those days of calm! He had led them to that
      waterlogged vessel! He had gone on board with them; he had caused them to
      put a confidence in that wrecked ship which was not justifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worst of all, he had left them!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that he thought of it, what was that ship? She might have been not
      water-logged&mdash;but sinking! The thought filled him with horror. A
      sinking ship! and he had left them there!
    </p>
    <p>
      No; she was not a sinking ship&mdash;he knew that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the length of time that he had seen her from a distance. He
      recalled the time he had been on board, and all the observations which he
      had made. Water-logged she certainly was, but not sinking&mdash;no, not
      sinking. Timber ships never sink. They cannot sink. A timber ship is like
      a solid wooden ship low down in the water, but absolutely unsinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought brought some consolation to him in his despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he looked out over the sea, as he saw the swelling waves, as he
      felt the Antelope toss, and leap, and plunge about, and as he recalled the
      long night that had passed, with its storms and billows, he trembled for
      the boys in the water-logged ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again the old question came back,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys whom he had left in the water-logged ship? He himself
      had anchored that ship in these waters, hard and fast; but now, as he
      looked about far over the seas, he saw no sign of any ship, or of any
      floating thing save that distant fishing schooner. What did this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again he asked this question, and again and again he shrank back
      from the answer that suggested itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to console himself by thinking of the buoyancy of wood in
      general, and of timber ships in particular. Alas! these efforts were all
      in vain. For he remembered how rough the sea had been; and he saw all
      around him even now the swelling waves. That ship had already been torn
      and shattered by storms. That ship had been forsaken by captain and crew.
      They had believed that she was about to founder. Was this belief, then, so
      far wrong as he had supposed? She was like a raft, torn and dislocated,
      which any fresh movement of the water might shatter to pieces. Perhaps in
      the storm that had fallen upon her in his absence the waves had wrought
      their will upon her. Perhaps they had torn her to pieces in their wrath,
      and scattered all her timbers afar over the surface of the deep. Perhaps
      the only vestige of the Petrel which his eyes might ever see, might be
      some floating timbers drifting past, and bearing to him the only message
      which could ever come to the land of the living from the lost boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, O, where were the boys whom he had led into danger, and then madly
      deserted?&mdash;doubly deserted, in fact; first, when he sailed away,
      leaving them on board the wrecked ship, and secondly, in that worse
      desertion, when he had gone away so thoughtlessly, so wickedly, and so
      madly, from the Magdalen Islands to the Miramichi River? How could he have
      ever thought of it? What could have so infatuated him as to lead him so
      far away from those helpless boys in their desperate position?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys?
    </p>
    <p>
      O, where were the boys? And what had they thought of him? What misery had
      they not suffered! What despair! How often must they have watched for his
      return! And day had succeeded to day, and night to night, but he had never
      come! While they were watching for his appearance, he was calmly sailing
      away, or was loitering in distant ports, leaving them to their terrific
      fate!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the boys?
    </p>
    <p>
      What was their fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      What had become of that ship?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been anchored fast. She was gone now. Gone! Gone were those boys,
      for whom he would have laid down his life; but whom, nevertheless, he had
      deserted and betrayed. And he&mdash;what could he do? Where could he go?
      Where could he search for them? Over what seas could he sail? With what
      hope? Was there any hope? Hope! Alas! what hope could he form when he
      looked out over these foaming waves, and felt the Antelope quiver beneath
      the force of their assault?
    </p>
    <p>
      These, or something very much like these, were the thoughts that filled
      the soul of the unhappy, the despairing Corbet, as he rolled his venerable
      eyes over the wide waste of waters, and saw that the Petrel was gone. It
      was a moment full of deeper misery and keener anguish than any which the
      good captain had ever known in the whole course of his life, though that
      life had by no means been without its sufferings. Yet among all the
      sufferings and sorrows of a life full of vicissitudes, it had never fallen
      to his lot to experience such a misfortune as this,&mdash;to reproach
      himself so keenly, so severely, and yet so justly. Whatever the fate of
      the boys might have been, he knew perfectly well that he, and he alone,
      was the cause; nor could he plead, even to his own conscience, the excuse
      that his motives were right. For his motives were not right, and he knew
      it. His motives had been nothing better than wild desires for sudden
      wealth. True, he had only wished that wealth for his &ldquo;babby;&rdquo; but that did
      not in the least mitigate his offence. At the very least, he had been
      guilty of carelessness so gross that it was hardly inferior to downright,
      deliberate crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the poor captain&rsquo;s anguish of soul was extreme, and utter, as well it
      might be. So keen, indeed, was his suffering, that his hair might have
      turned white from its severity,&mdash;a circumstance not unusual,&mdash;but
      in the captain&rsquo;s case it was not possible, since, as is well known, his
      hair was already as gray as it well could be, and therefore the good
      Captain Corbet could only suffer in secret, and occasionally wipe away the
      tears that dropped from his eyes with the sleeve of his venerable coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the thought occurred to him that perhaps he had not come to the
      right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his mind, the thought was well nigh inconceivable; yet, after all, it
      was barely possible, and in his despair he caught at this straw. After
      all, navigation by dead reckoning is not the most accurate way in the
      world of working one&rsquo;s way along; and Captain Corbet felt this in an
      obscure and shadowy sort of way; so it need not be wondered at if he
      sought relief in the thought that he had possibly gone astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he called upon Wade to take the helm, while he went below to make some
      elaborate calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did it in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first got a mug of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he seated himself by the cabin table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he dipped the fore finger of his right hand in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with this finger, he traced certain mysterious marks upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, these mysterious marks were designed by this ancient mariner to
      represent nothing less than the coasts surrounding the Gulf of St.
      Lawrence. To an unprejudiced observer, this idea would never have
      suggested itself; but to the mind of the venerable Corbet, these marks
      were as plain and as intelligible as the finest outlines of the Admiralty
      charts engraved in steel, and bristling with names of places. In his
      mind&rsquo;s eye he could see everything. He could see Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island,
      Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Gaspé, the Bay de Chaleur, Miramichi, and the
      Magdalen Islands. There, too, full and fair, in the centre of the scene, a
      big wet spot, made most emphatically with his thumb, showed him the spot
      where he had left the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was Captain Corbet&rsquo;s chart, and this was his mode of navigating,
      and this was the scientific method which he adopted in order to work his
      way out of a difficulty. Quadrant, sextant, and other instruments of that
      character he did not need; he trusted to his own head, and to his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that, on this occasion, these resources rather failed
      him. The puzzle seemed insoluble. In vain he obliterated the wet spot
      where he first stationed the Petrel. In vain he made another dab with his
      thumb in a second place. He could not arrive at any conclusion which was
      entirely satisfactory. He placed the mug of water on the table, leaned his
      aged head in both hands, and sat watching his chart in profound thought. A
      sudden sea struck the Antelope. The good vessel leaped, as was natural, at
      such rough treatment. As was natural, also, the mug of water leaped.
      Moreover, it upset. The contents poured forth, and inundated the fable.
      The chart was all obliterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this casualty Captain Corbet rose. He betrayed no excitement, no
      passion. He did not swear, as some wrecked sea captains have done. He did
      not even utter an exclamation. He simply took his aged coat tail and wiped
      the water off the table very carefully, and then with his other aged coat
      tail he dried it, and even polished it most elaborately. The table had not
      been so clean for ever so long. It seemed to be astonished at itself.
      Captain Corbet, meanwhile, remained mild and patient. Sir Isaac Newton
      himself, after the burning of his Principia by his immortal little dog
      Diamond, was not more placid. Without a word, our captain went to the
      bucket, replenished the mug, returned to the table, resumed his seat, and,
      holding the mug in his left hand, under the table, to prevent a recurrence
      of this mishap, he dipped the fore finger of his right hand into the
      water, and proceeded to retrace upon the table the outline of his chart.
      In a little while there appeared before his eyes, as plain as before, the
      Gulf of St. Lawrence, with all the surrounding coasts&mdash;Cape Breton,
      Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Gaspé, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, and
      plain in the middle the dab of his venerable thumb representing the spot
      where he had left the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the problem remained insoluble. He was certain that he had come back
      to the right spot. Again and again he traced, in a thin line, made by his
      wet finger-nail, the course which he had taken; first, from the Petrel to
      the Magdalen Islands, and, secondly, from the Magdalen Islands to
      Miramichi, and, thirdly, from Miramichi to the place where he now was. In
      each case his course had, fortunately, been quite straight. Had there been
      head winds, it might have been different; but, as it was, the straight
      course which he had kept made the outlines on the table all the more
      simple, but at the same time they made the problem all the more complex.
      The ship was missing. He had left her at anchor. She could not sink. What,
      then, had become of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first answer was the terrible one that she had gone to pieces in the
      storm. But this was the very one from which he was seeking to escape, and
      against which he sought refuge in such facts as her strength and the
      stiffness of a timber cargo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what other conclusion was there?
    </p>
    <p>
      That he had mistaken his way?
    </p>
    <p>
      Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table before him the marks that he had made confirmed him in the
      opinion that he was, if not on the identical spot where he had left the
      Petrel, at least sufficiently near to be able to see her if she still was
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet here she evidently was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, had become of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      To this only one answer remained, and in this he sought to find comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have dragged her anchor, and might have thereby drifted, under
      the pressure of the storm, far enough away to be out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in what direction had she drifted?
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had been south by east. He knew that well enough. This one fact,
      then, showed him what course she would have taken when adrift. .
    </p>
    <p>
      He wet his finger now for the last time. He planted it down upon the place
      which he had marked as the position of the Petrel, and then drew a line in
      the direction which he supposed might indicate the course of her drift.
      Then he stopped to calculate the possible distance which she might have
      traversed while dragging her anchor, and made a mark to represent what,
      under this theory, might be her present position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then rose to his feet, and surveyed his chart for a few moments with a
      thoughtful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the time had come for action. He had at last a theory. His mind
      was made up. He hurried upon deck, and, seizing the tiller, headed the
      Antelope north by west, in the direction which he conjectured the drifting
      ship to have taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had allowed between twenty and thirty miles for her drift. He had
      calculated that a mile an hour would be a fair allowance for a vessel that
      was dragging her anchor, and he did not think that the wind had been
      strong enough to make her drag her anchor for more than twenty hours, and
      certainly, as he thought, not more than thirty, at the farthest. Upon this
      principle he acted, and when he headed the Antelope north by west, he
      hoped to catch sight of the lost ship before noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Antelope, with a fair wind, could make as much as four or five
      miles an hour; and, after making every allowance for currents, or for
      leeway, she ought to do twenty miles between six o&rsquo;clock in the morning
      and midday. And so, full of confidence in the ability of the Antelope to
      do her duty, Captain Corbet took his station at the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that a gleam of hope had appeared, he was a different man. The gleam
      became brighter and brighter, until at last it grew to be positive
      sunshine. He forgot his recent despair. The more he thought of his theory
      of the Petrel dragging her anchor, the more convinced he was that it was
      correct, and the more certain he was that he would ultimately catch sight
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he kept on his course, with his eyes fixed on the horizon before
      him, anxiously awaiting the time when he would descry the masts of the
      lost vessel becoming gradually defined against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope sailed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midday came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope had traversed the distance which her commander had allotted
      for the utmost possible drift of the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet not the slightest sign of the Petrel had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hopes upon which Captain Corbet had been relying gradually sank under
      him. When midday came, and the masts of the Petrel did not appear, hope
      sank away, and despondency came, and despondency deepened into despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that he had felt at early dawn, when he first looked abroad upon the
      seas and found her not, now came back to him,&mdash;all the self-reproach,
      all the remorse, all the anguish of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the helm, and let the Antelope pass onward, but there was no
      longer any hope in his mind. He was overwhelmed, and now even the
      possibility of finding her seemed to be taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the wind had gone on increasing in violence, and the sea had
      risen more and more. For himself and for the Antelope Captain Corbet did
      not care; but the lowery sky and the stormy sea seemed terrible to him,
      for they spoke to him of the lost boys, and told a tale of horror.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE unfortunate Corbet thus found himself
      in a state of despair. The situation, indeed; could not possibly be worse.
      The ship was gone; and where? Who could tell? Certainly not he. He had
      exhausted all his resources. From the cabin table he was unable to elicit
      any further information, nor could his aged brain furnish forth
      intellectual power which was at all adequate to the problem before it. He
      was alone. He had none to help him. With Wade he did not offer to take
      counsel, feeling, perhaps, that Wade would be about as useful in this
      emergency as the Antelope&rsquo;s pump. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the storm increased, and Captain Corbet felt himself unable to
      contend with it. The tattered old sails of the Antelope were
      double-reefed, but seemed every moment about to fly into ribbons. There
      was no object in keeping his present course any longer; and so he decided,
      in view of the storm and his own indecision, to lie to. And now the
      Antelope tossed, and pitched, and kicked, and bounded beneath Captain
      Corbet, <br /><br /><span class="indent30">"like a steed <br /><span
      class="indent25">That knows its rider,&rdquo; </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and Wade went below, and took refuge in sleep; and the good, the brave,
      yet the unhappy Corbet took up his position upon the windlass, and
      bestriding it, he sat for hours peering into space. There were no thoughts
      whatever in his mind. He tried not to speculate, he attempted not to solve
      the problem; but there was, deep down in his soul, a dark, drear sense of
      desolation, a woful feeling of remorse and of despair. Nothing attracted
      his attention on that wide sea or troubled sky; not the waste of foaming
      waters, not the giant masses of storm clouds, nor yet that fishing
      schooner, which, only a few miles off was also, like the Antelope, lying
      to. Captain Corbet did not notice this stranger; he did not speculate upon
      the cause of her presence; he did not see that she was the identical
      vessel that he had noticed before, and therefore did not wonder why it was
      that he had been followed so long and so persistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sat on the windlass, and gazed forth into illimitable space.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the long, long hours passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deepening into night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night, and storm, and darkness came down, and the Antelope tossed, and
      plunged, and kicked, and jumped; yet the sleepless Corbet remained on
      deck, occasionally shifting his position, but still overwhelmed by has
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards midnight the storm abated. Corbet waited a few hours longer, and
      then stole below, hoping to forget his misery and relieve his fatigues by
      a little sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air of the cabin seemed to suffocate him. Sleep was impossible. His
      distressing thoughts seemed to drive him into a fever; he tried hard and
      for a long time to overcome them, and finally succeeded in getting a short
      nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time it was dawn, and the good captain rose, and went upon deck,
      feeling dejected and miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out over the waters, and noticed that the strange schooner was
      bearing down straight towards him. She was coming bows on, so that at
      first he did not know her from any other vessel; but at length she came
      up, and hove to close by, disclosing the symmetrical hull, the beautiful
      lines, the slender, tapering masts, and the swelling, snow-white canvas of
      the Fawn. At the same moment he saw a boat drop alongside, and into this
      leaped Captain Tobias Ferguson, who at once pulled to the Antelope, and in
      a few minutes stood on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time that he had seen Captain Ferguson he had looked upon him in
      the light of a busybody, a vexatious and too inquisitive spy, a persecutor
      and a tormentor. But now circumstances had changed so utterly, and Captain
      Corbet&rsquo;s sufferings both of mind and body had been so acute, that the once
      dreaded Ferguson appeared to him almost equal to some Heaven-sent
      deliverer. His wan face flushed with joy; he could not speak; tears burst
      from his eyes; and seizing Ferguson&rsquo;s hand in both of his, he clasped it
      tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson darted over him one swift, keen glance that took in everything,
      but made no comment upon the emotion that was so visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re bound to meet again. The fact is, I was bound not
      to lose sight of you. I tell you I got those boys on my brain, and
      couldn&rsquo;t get them out no how. I knew you were going to find them, or to
      try to find them. I believed they were all in danger, and so I up sail and
      followed. And a precious hard job that following was. Why, it was like
      making a race-horse follow a snail. I had to turn back every other mile or
      so, and go away. I saw you lie to yesterday, so I lay to; and here I am
      this morning, right side up, and ready to repeat my question, Where are
      the boys? So come, now, old man; no humbug, no shuffling. You&rsquo;re in a fix.
      I know it well enough. You&rsquo;ve lost the boys. Very well. I&rsquo;ll help you find
      &rsquo;em. So, now, make a clean breast of it, and tell me all about it
      from the very beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Ferguson seated himself on the taffrail, and drawing forth a
      cigar, lighted it, and waited for Captain Corbet to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for Captain Corbet there was the difficulty. How could he begin? How
      could he tell the miserable story of his madness and his folly? of the
      ignorant confidence of the poor boys? of his culpable and guilty
      negligence, doubly guilty, since he had deserted them not only once in
      leaving the ship, but a second time in sailing away from the Magdalen
      Islands? And for what purpose? Even had he reached the ship with the
      sails, could he really have saved her? Yet here stood his inquisitor, and
      this time his questions must be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; began Captain Corbet, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;I left em&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;left&mdash;left&mdash;em&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I &lsquo;&mdash;I&mdash;left em, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you said three times; but I knew that before. The question is, Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aboard a ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aboard a ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship? Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhar&rsquo;s about here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About here? But what ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;was&mdash;she&mdash;she was&mdash;wa-wa-water-logged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Ferguson started to his feet, almost leaping in the air as he did
      so. For a moment he regarded the unhappy Corbet with an expression of
      mingled horror and incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Ferguson. &ldquo;Were you mad? Were they mad? Were you all raving,
      stark, staring distracted? What were you all thinking of? A water-logged
      ship! Why, do you mean to stand there in your boots, look me in the face,
      and tell me that about the boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet trembled from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A water-logged ship! Why, you might as well tell me you pitched them all
      overboard and drowned them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet shuddered, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson laid his hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, more quietly, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t have been such a fool! You
      must have considered that the boys had some chance. What sort of a ship
      was she? What was her cargo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timber,&rdquo; said the mournful Corbet in a melancholy wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson&rsquo;s face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gospel sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not deals, now, or laths, or palings, or pickets, or battens, or anything
      of that sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the timber&mdash;white pine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s better; that gives them a chance. I&rsquo;ve heard say that a
      timber ship&rsquo;ll float for years, if she&rsquo;s any kind of a ship at all; and
      so, perhaps, this one is drifting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Ferguson, noticing the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I anchored her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchored her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchored what? The timber ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchored her? That&rsquo;s queer! And where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, somewhars about twenty mile or so back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere about twenty mile or so back!&rdquo; repeated Ferguson. &ldquo;Why, the
      man&rsquo;s mad! See here, old man; what do you mean by anchoring hereabouts?
      Did you try soundings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, n-n-no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware that the bottom is several miles down below, and that all
      the chains and ropes of that ship, if they were all tied together in one
      line, wouldn&rsquo;t begin to reach half way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, railly, I hadn&rsquo;t any idee. I jest kine o&rsquo; dropped anchor to
      hold the ship till I got back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; said Ferguson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a very good general idea of your
      proceedings; but I want a few more particulars, so that I can judge for
      myself about the poor lads. So I&rsquo;ll trouble you to make a clean breast of
      it, and in particular to let me know why you kept so close when I asked
      you about it before. Close? Why, if you&rsquo;d been decoying those boys out
      there on purpose to get rid of them, you couldn&rsquo;t have fought shyer of my
      questions than you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Captain Corbet proceeded, as Ferguson called it, to &ldquo;make a
      clean breast of it.&rdquo; He began at the first, told about their failure in
      provisions, their discovery of the ship, and his project of saving her. He
      explained all about his reticence on the subject at the Magdalen Islands,
      and the cause of his voyage to Miramichi. All this was accompanied with
      frequent interruptions, expressive of self-reproach, exculpation, remorse,
      misery, and pitiable attempts at excusing his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson listened to all without expressing any opinion, merely asking a
      question for information here and there; and at the close of Captain
      Corbet&rsquo;s confession, he remained forborne a considerable time buried in
      profound reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the whole story is one that won&rsquo;t bear criticism. I
      won&rsquo;t begin. If I did, you&rsquo;d hear a little of the tallest swearing that
      ever came to your ears. No, old man; I&rsquo;ve got a wicked temper, and I won&rsquo;t
      get on that subject. The thing that you and me have got to do is, to see
      what can be done about those boys, and then to do it right straight off.
      That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do; and when I say <i>we</i>, I mean <i>myself</i>,
      for you appear to have done about as much mischief as is needful for one
      lifetime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson now began to pace the deck, and kept this up for about half an
      hour, at the end of which time he resumed his seat on the taffrail.
      Captain Corbet watched him with wistful eyes, and in deep suspense; yet
      there was already upon his venerable face somewhat less of grief, for he
      felt a strange confidence in this eager, energetic, active, strong man,
      whose pertinacity had been so extraordinary, and whose singular affection
      for the boys had been so true and so tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning,&rdquo; said Ferguson, at length, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to see my way
      towards action, and that&rsquo;s something; though whether it&rsquo;ll result in
      anything is more than I can begin to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I go on the theory that this timber ship didn&rsquo;t sink;
      that she stood this blow as solid as though she was carved out of a single
      stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the second place, I scout your idea of anchoring her. That is rank,
      raving insanity. To anchor a ship in three miles of water! Old man, go
      home; you have no business on the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she&rsquo;s been drifting; yes, drifting. She was drifting when you found
      her, and drifting when you left her. Where she was you can&rsquo;t tell, seeing
      that you can&rsquo;t take an observation, and didn&rsquo;t take one. So we&rsquo;re all
      astray there, and I can only calculate her probable position from the
      course you took to the Magdalen Islands, and the time occupied in making
      the trip by that astonishing old tub of yours, that disgraces and
      ridicules the respectable name of Antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Now say she&rsquo;s afloat, and has been drifting. The question is,
      Where has she drifted to? She probably was found by you somewhere about
      here. That was about a week ago. Well, after the calm was over, then came
      a wind. That wind was a south-easter. It got up at last into a storm, like
      the blow last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there are two things to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second, the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, as to the wind. It was a steady southeaster for nearly a week,
      ending in a hard blow. That wind has had a tendency to blow her over in
      that direction&mdash;over there, nor&rsquo;-west. In that direction she must
      have been steadily pushed, unless there was something to prevent, some
      ocean currents or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this brings us to the next point&mdash;the currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, over there, about thirty miles south of this, there is a current
      setting out into the Atlantic from the River St. Lawrence; and up there,
      thirty miles to the north, there is considerable of a current, that runs
      up into the Straits of Belle Isle. Just round about here there is a sort
      of eddy, or a back current, that flows towards the Island of Anticosti.
      Now, that happens to be the identical place towards which the wind would
      carry her. So, you see, granting that the Petrel has remained afloat, the
      wind and the currents must both have acted on her in such a way as to
      carry her to that desert island, that horrible, howling wilderness, that
      abomination of desolation, that graveyard of ships and seamen&mdash;Anticosti.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this intelligence, Captain Corbet&rsquo;s heart once more sank within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anti&mdash;Anticosti!&rdquo; he murmured, in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Anticosti. And I ain&rsquo;t surprised, not a bit surprised,&rdquo; said
      Ferguson. &ldquo;I said so. I prophesied it. I was sure of it. I read it in
      their faces at Magdalen. When I saw that rotten old tub, and those
      youngsters, something told me they were going to wind up by getting on
      Anticosti. When I saw you come back to Magdalen, I was sure of it. I
      followed you to Miramichi to find out; and ever since I&rsquo;ve been following
      you, I&rsquo;ve had Anticosti in my mind, as the only place I was bound to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at any rate, it&rsquo;s better for them than bein&mdash;bein&mdash;at&mdash;at
      the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t any better, if they&rsquo;ve been smashed against the rocks of
      Anticosti in last night&rsquo;s gale,&rdquo; retorted Ferguson, who was not willing
      that Captain Corbet should recover from his anxiety too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mayn&rsquo;t she&mdash;mayn&rsquo;t she&mdash;catch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;her&mdash;her anchor. It&rsquo;s been down all the time. That thar
      anchor had ought to catch hold of somethin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson slapped his thighs with both hands with tremendous force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! right are you, old man, for once! For the moment, I had
      forgotten about the anchor. That saves them. That anchor&rsquo;s bound to catch;
      for, after all, I don&rsquo;t think last night&rsquo;s storm was bad enough to make
      her drag. At any rate, it gives them a chance, And now&mdash;off we go.&rdquo;
       With these words, Ferguson jumped into his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head once more. &ldquo;Old man, mark me&mdash;? all you&rsquo;ve got to
      do is to follow straight after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll get away in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will. Well, then, you head straight nothe-west and by nothe. I&rsquo;ll
      pick you up some time tomorrow. We&rsquo;ll cruise along the shore of Anticosti
      till we find the ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Ferguson seized the oars. A dozen strokes brought him
      alongside of his own schooner. He leaped on board, and the boat was hauled
      up astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the Fawn spread her snow-white wings, and headed away
      &ldquo;nothe-west and by nothe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before evening the Fawn was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Corbet stood calmly and confidently at the helm, and steered
      &ldquo;nothe-west and by nothe.&rdquo; His despair had subsided, leaving only a mild
      melancholy that was not unbecoming; but his soul was full of hope, for he
      had confidence in Ferguson.

      <br /><br /><span class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap"
       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE cove into which they pulled seemed to
      the boys to be the most beautiful place that they had ever seen. Such a
      thought was natural, after such a passage from the wrecked ship, and from
      the terrors of the sea to this peaceful and sheltered nook; and, indeed,
      more unprejudiced observers might have been charmed with such a place. The
      hills encircled it, covered with trees; the brook babbled over pebbles
      into the sea; the grassy knoll rose invitingly in front of them; while
      behind them was the sea, upon which the ship floated low in the water. The
      boys looked upon this with enthusiastic delight; but Solomon&rsquo;s face was
      turned away; he was bowed down low, and staring intently into the water.
      That water was astonishingly clear and transparent; and Solomon found an
      attractiveness in the sea bottom which made all other things seem dull and
      commonplace. He said nothing, however, and the boys were too much taken up
      with the beauties of the place to notice his attitude. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the biscuit and the chest of provisions were put ashore;
      and Solomon&rsquo;s first act was to take the former out of the barrel and
      spread them out over the grass, so that they might dry in the sun. But the
      boys had other aims. Their first desire was to explore the country; and as
      they knew well from past experience how easy it was to get lost in the
      woods, they sought about, first of all, for some sort of a path or trail.
      Nothing of the kind could be seen. Phil then suggested going up the bed of
      the brook. His forest experiences had made him far more fruitful in
      resources than any of them; and the stream occurred to him at once as the
      readiest way of passing through the impenetrable forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they all set forth by this path. The brook was not very wide,
      and the trees almost met overhead; the water was only a few inches in
      depth, chiefly composed of gravel, and occasionally interspersed with
      larger masses, which offered a succession of stepping-stones. As they went
      along, they never ceased to look most carefully in all directions for any
      traces of a path, however faint. The utter absence of anything of the sort
      excited their surprise, but only led them to continue their journey still
      farther. The way at length grew more difficult. They came to a rising
      ground, where the brook had worn a bed for itself. Here the path became
      rough, and full of mud and clay. Every few steps they came to trees which
      had fallen across. But they worked their way along bravely, and at length
      reached the top of the rising ground. Here they found themselves in the
      forest, with nothing visible on every side but spruce trees of moderate
      size. They walked on for two or three hours, traversing fallen trees, and
      rocks, and mud; but at length they came to a place where the brook lost
      itself in a swampy soil. Here there was a dense and impenetrable
      underbrush, and no longer even such a pathway as the bed of the brook had
      afforded. They all saw that it was impossible to proceed any farther, and
      therefore they concluded to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their calculations led them to suppose that they had gone many miles; yet
      in all that distance they had found no trace whatever of any human beings.
      They had not come upon even the rudest trail. This fact impressed them all
      very forcibly. Hitherto, each one had had a different theory as to the
      country; and no less than five provinces were claimed, in order to support
      the theory of each. But they all knew that it would be difficult indeed to
      find a place in any one of those five provinces, where a march could be
      made for so great a distance, without encountering some signs of humanity,
      past, if not present. In all of them the woods had been scoured by
      lumbering parties, or, at least, by hunting parties; and if there were no
      paths made by lumbermen, there might be found, at least, some trail. Pat,
      of course, gave up the Magdalen Islands; Bruce gave up Miramichi: Tom,
      Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island; and Bart, Cape Breton. There remained, then, the
      belief of Phil in Newfoundland, and that of Arthur in Gaspé. Upon these
      two localities the party divided; and though in the laborious journey back
      they were too much fatigued to expend their breath in argument, yet, when
      they did reach their journey&rsquo;s end, they were all prepared for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all argument was postponed for the present by the advent of dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when they got back. They had eaten nothing since breakfast.
      They found Solomon waiting for them most impatiently. He had kindled a
      fire under a rock, and had taken the trouble to go back to the ship for
      some pots, kettles, and pans. A pot was even now hanging over the fire,
      and when they reached the place, there issued from this pot a stream so
      savory, so aromatic, so odoriferous, and so enticing, that in an instant
      every other thought vanished from their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Solomon,&rdquo; was the cry, &ldquo;what is it that you&rsquo;ve got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they rushed up to the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Solomon, brandishing a huge ladle, waved them back with solemn
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look heah, chilen; don&rsquo;t you go bodder yer heads bout dis yer; it&rsquo;s a
      kine o&rsquo; soup dat I ben a concoctin&rsquo;; an you&rsquo;ll know when de time comes.
      Jes now, you&rsquo;d all bes lie down ober dar, an res yourselves. I ben
      worritin&rsquo; bout you for ten hour an more. You didn&rsquo;t ought to go for to &rsquo;crease
      de &rsquo;ziety ob dis ole man; cos he ain&rsquo;t able to hole up. But nebber
      mind; you&rsquo;re all safe an soun; so now you all jes lay by a few minutes, an
      I&rsquo;ll walk dis yer dish off de hook in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys respected Solomon&rsquo;s whim, and fell back. A few dishes, with
      spoons, were lying on the grass, and towards these they allowed themselves
      to drift, and then flung their weary frames upon the ground near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon was true to his word. He did not keep them long waiting. In a
      short time he took the pot off the fire, and brought it towards them. He
      then filled each of the dishes in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savory steam rose up; its odor was now unmistakable. Scarce able to
      believe the evidence of the sense of smell, they hurried to appeal to that
      of taste. One mouthful was enough. A cry of joy burst from them all,
      followed by,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oysters! Oyster stew! O, glorious! Solomon, where in the world did you
      find these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon&rsquo;s eyes beamed with quiet exultation; he drew a long breath of
      silent rapture, and gently rubbed his-old hands together. For a few
      moments his emotions deprived him of the power of utterance; but at length
      he found voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, chilen, to tell de troof, I intended it as a great &lsquo;prise, for you.
      I saw dem dis yer mornin when we landed, and didn&rsquo;t say nuffin. But dar
      dey is&mdash;dem&rsquo;s um. De cove is full; nuff heah to feed a ship&rsquo;s company
      ten years; an we&rsquo;s boun to feed on de fat ob de lan so long as we stick to
      dis yer place. Dat&rsquo;s so; mind I tell you. Yes, sir.&rdquo; After such a repast
      as this, they all felt much more able to grapple with the difficulties of
      their situation. And now once more arose the question, what land this was
      upon which they had been thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use now to talk about the Magdalen
      Islands, or Prince Edward&rsquo;s Island, or Cape Breton, or even Miramichi.
      This coast lies east and west, as we saw while we were drifting towards
      it. We came from a southeast direction towards it; we can tell now.
      There&rsquo;s the west, where the sun is soon going to set, and there&rsquo;s the
      south. Now, my idea is, that this must be Gaspé. Besides, the desolation
      of the country shows that it must be Gaspé.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phil shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaspé doesn&rsquo;t lie east and west,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and it may just as well be
      Miramichi as Gaspé. The fact is, it can&rsquo;t be either of them. It must be
      Newfoundland. We&rsquo;ve drifted up from the south, and have been driven upon
      these shores. I can&rsquo;t imagine where it is, but I rather think it may be
      the south-west corner of the island. If that is right, then settlements
      ought to be not very far away; only we can&rsquo;t get to them by land. There&rsquo;s
      St. Pierre&rsquo;s Island east, and there&rsquo;s the Bay of Islands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a bad lookout&rsquo; for us,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;if there isn&rsquo;t any
      settlement nearer than St. Pierre or the Bay of Islands. Why, there are
      hundreds of miles of the roughest coast in the world lying between. We may
      be on the coast, as you say; somewhere between Cape Ray and Fortune&rsquo;s Bay;
      but how we are ever to get to any settlement is a little beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the boat,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do with the boat?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;We have no oars. I don&rsquo;t feel
      inclined to set out on a long journey with paddles like those. They do
      very well to land a shipwrecked party, but are hardly the things to start
      off with on a sea voyage. I tried going about with a bit of board once,
      and didn&rsquo;t find, that it worked very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we can rig up a sail. We can get something on board the Petrel that&rsquo;ll
      do&mdash;some quilts, or, better yet, some sheets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheets aren&rsquo;t big enough,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can sew two or three of them together. They&rsquo;re good, strong
      sheets, and they&rsquo;ll do very well for the boat. As for a mast, why, we can
      find a very good one here in the woods in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what direction should we take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a question that requires a good deal of careful
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion is,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that it is by far the best to sail east. If we
      sail west, we could scarce hope to meet with any one till we got to the
      Bay of Islands; and we&rsquo;d have to double Cape Bay,&mdash;which is
      altogether too dangerous a thing for a little boat like this. But if we go
      east, we&rsquo;ll have more chances of shelter in case of storms, and we&rsquo;ll be
      sure to reach some sort of settlement, either St. Pierre or some fishing
      stations on the main land, or in Fortune&rsquo;s Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East, then, is the course,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;And now, who of us shall go? We&rsquo;d
      better not all go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no; I suppose not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;The boat isn&rsquo;t large enough. Two will be
      plenty. The rest of us can stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the boat goes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;those of us who stay behind won&rsquo;t be
      able to go on board the ship.&rsquo; Shall we stay aboard or ashore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t put a fut aboard that ship again as long
      as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here, or else go in the boat,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to do
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite of Pat&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not anxious to visit the ship again,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;not even as a
      salvor, and I certainly would not stay aboard of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too comfortable here altogether,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so say I,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;The fact is, boys, we&rsquo;re all of one mind
      about the Petrel. Her glory is departed; and after that night in the
      mizzen-top, we don&rsquo;t fancy trying any other nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;the wind has changed. It&rsquo;ll be fair for the boat
      if she goes east.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are to go?&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;that the best way will be to draw lots. What do
      you say, boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this proposal they all assented. Bruce thereupon took some bits of
      grass, and broke them up into different lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of these,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are short; the rest are long. Those who draw the
      short ones are to go in the boat. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Bruce put the pieces of grass in his hat, stirred them about;
      and then laid the hat in the midst. Each one then shut his eyes and took a
      piece of grass from the hat. Then they all held them forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was seen that the two shortest pieces had been drawn by Arthur and
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this every one of the other boys offered to exchange places with
      either one of these, and go in his stead. But Arthur and Tom were both
      firm in their refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to take with you?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;first of all, we&rsquo;ll need to have a sail. I think
      we&rsquo;d better make a raid on the Petrel at once, and hunt up some sheets.
      Tom and I will go, and you fellows might find a couple of sticks that&rsquo;ll
      do for the mast and pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, by the way,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going aboard, you&rsquo;d better bring
      back some more biscuit. We won&rsquo;t have enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and help you,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys now pushed off,&mdash;Arthur, and Tom, and Bruce, and Phil. In
      about a quarter of an hour they reached the ship, and boarded her. They
      noticed now that the change of the wind had caused a corresponding change
      of position. She had swung round at her anchor, and was very much nearer
      the headland before spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s been dragging her anchor a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s certainly a good deal nearer the shore,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so deep down,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;ll touch bottom if she drags
      much longer,&mdash;and a strong breeze might do it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it does,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;then good by forever to her. A timber ship may
      hold together as long as she keeps in deep water; but these rocks would
      soon grind her to powder, if she touched them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her grind,&rdquo; say I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I give up my share of the salvage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best place for her will be the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, we&rsquo;ll make one final haul, boys, and take ashore everything
      that may be needed at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys now hurried to complete their preparations, for the sun was not
      more than one half hour above the horizon, and there was no time to spare.
      Arthur went to secure the sails. He selected a half dozen of the largest
      sheets, and flung them into the boat. They were the coarsest and strongest
      which he could find. Tom found some sail needles and sail twine in a
      drawer in the pantry, where he remembered having seen them before.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then rolled out four barrels of biscuit, and put them on board the
      boat. After this they put six hams in her, and all the rest of the potted
      meat, and canned vegetables, and other dainties. Phil looked with longing
      eyes at the galley stove, but concluded that it was best not to try to
      convey that ashore. Finally, they took all the blankets, for they were
      articles that promised to be always useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this cargo they returned to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur then went to work at his sail, while Tom went to see about the
      mast. He found that Bart had already nearly finished one that was very
      suitable. In smoothing this, in fitting it into the boat, and in shaping a
      pole, another hour or so was taken up. Meanwhile Arthur had found that
      three of the sheets were large enough. These he stitched together, and
      afterwards cut it the right shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then secured to the mast, and the little boat was all ready for her
      voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had still more preparations to make. First of all, the spy-glass,
      which had been brought ashore in the chest, was deposited in the boat.
      Then, a barrel of the biscuit that Solomon had dried in the sun was put on
      board, together with a sufficient supply of potted meats. A jug of water
      was considered sufficient, as they expected to land from time to time, and
      would be able to replenish it, if it should be necessary. For warmth or
      shelter, three or four blankets, which the careful forethought of Solomon
      had dried in front of the blazing fire, were deemed amply sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before these were completed it was dark. Of course they had no intention
      of setting off that evening, though Tom was at first of the opinion that
      they had better start, and take advantage of so fine a night. But the
      others overruled him, and expressed the opinion that they had better sail
      by night as little as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon kept the fire heaped high with fuel, not for the purposes of
      warmth, for the air was balmy and pleasant, but more for the sake of
      cheerfulness. He had found no difficulty in procuring dry wood from the
      fallen trees in the forest. Brightly the flames leaped up, throwing a
      pleasant glow over the surrounding scene. The contrast between this
      evening and the evening of the previous day was thought of and felt by
      all; and more than once there arose from the warm, grateful hearts of
      these honest lads a prayer of thankfulness to that Being who had heard
      their cry in the stormy sea, and had saved them from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning they were all awake. Solomon already had breakfast
      prepared. It was a bright and beautiful morning. The little cove looked
      charming. But on the sea the Petrel still floated; but they were all sure
      that she was nearer than ever to the headland.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant breeze was blowing, and all things promised well. Arthur and
      Tom finished their breakfast, and then, bidding all the rest good by, they
      embarked, and pushed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind filled the sail, and the little boat moved out of the cove, and
      away to sea. The boys watched their departing friends in solemn silence,
      until the white sail disappeared around the headland.

      some time. The departure of Arthur and Tom had made a perceptible breach

      uncertain, and a perilous expedition seemed to throw an air of gloom over
      those who remained behind. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart was the first to rouse himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-four hours, with this wind; ought to do it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making a calculation. I don&rsquo;t see how St.
      Pierre can be more than a hundred miles from here at the very farthest.
      Now, this breeze ought to take them four or five miles an hour, and if
      they went on without stopping, they certainly ought to reach St. Pierre by
      this time to-morrow, even if they don&rsquo;t find any settlements or any
      fishing vessels on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but they won&rsquo;t find it so easy to get back,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, they will,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have to work their own way
      back. They&rsquo;ll get a schooner, and have no trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to allow a week, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do for us to tie them down to two days.
      If we do, we&rsquo;ll be all the time in a fever, and watch for them day and
      night. I&rsquo;m determined not to expect them at all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an that&rsquo;s the wisest risolution we can make, so it is,&rdquo; said Pat,
      sedately; &ldquo;and, be the same token, it&rsquo;s a month I&rsquo;m goin to allow, so it
      is; an, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m thinkin we&rsquo;ll betther be afther buildin a bit of
      a house, or tint, or camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A camp!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;s the very thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Phil; &ldquo;just like the camp in the woods behind the hill at
      Grand Pré.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best thing we could think of,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give us all
      something to do, and at the same time it&rsquo;s a positive necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we hadn&rsquo;t some of that spare lumber on board the Petrel,&rdquo;
       said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll have it all before another day; for,
      from present appearances, she&rsquo;ll be on the rocks soon; and if so, there&rsquo;ll
      be a general free delivery of her cargo all along the beach. But we
      needn&rsquo;t wait for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an there&rsquo;s nothin betther,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;thin good honist spruce. We
      can get sticks enough all around us, an have a camp that&rsquo;ll be as warrum,
      and as dhry, and as whowlsome as iver was, so we will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hatchet which had been brought ashore in the chest, and had
      already done good service in making the masts for the boat. This was now
      made use of for the purpose of getting the necessary supply of poles and
      brush for the camp. As there was only one hatchet, they could not of
      course cut the brush quite so fast as was desirable; but Bruce cut pretty
      quickly, and kept two of them well employed in carrying the poles and
      brush to the grassy knoll. Phil and Pat did this work while Bart occupied
      himself with the preparation of the ground for the erection of the camp.
      He first selected a place that seemed suitable, where there was a level
      space, about twelve feet square. Then he sharpened one of the stakes, and
      cutting off a portion of it, about three feet long, he hardened the point
      by burning it in the fire. He then marked out the line of foundation, and
      made holes in the ground all around the marked space, so that the stakes
      might be inserted without any delay. Fortunately there were no stones to
      interfere with his work. The ground was sandy, and he drove his stake in
      without any difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they worked until noon, when Solomon called them to dinner.
      All the boys were amazed at finding that the time had passed so rapidly;
      and they saw by this a fresh and striking example of the importance of
      having some pleasant occupation in life. It had been for want of this, to
      a great extent, that their time had dragged along so slowly, first during
      the famine on board the Antelope, and afterwards on board the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they examined their work, and concluded that the immense heap
      of stakes and brushwood ought to suffice for the needs of any ordinary
      camp; so now they proceeded to the important task of its erection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart had made a double row of holes around four sides, which were intended
      to enclose the camp. These holes were about a foot apart, and the rows
      were separated by a space of about three inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next task was to prepare the stakes. These were sharpened, and cut
      about seven feet long; and as fast as each one was prepared, it was
      inserted as tightly as possible in one of the holes. Before long all the
      stakes were set up, and the outline of the camp became dimly visible. Bart
      and Phil now went off in search of roots, which might serve the purpose of
      cords, to bind together those portions of the frame which needed securing,
      leaving Bruce and Pat at work preparing other stakes, the one with his
      hatchet, and the other with a knife. The roots were found without any
      difficulty, most of them belonging to a species of dwarf willow, or osier,
      and they were as flexible and as strong as the stoutest cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing was to take four long poles, and bind these along the top
      of each row of stakes, so as to form the eaves of the camp. When all these
      were secured, the framework was quite as strong as was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now remained to form the roof. This was a matter of some difficulty,
      but was at length successfully achieved. They had all had so much practice
      in camp-building, that there was but little hesitation at any stage of the
      proceedings. The way in which the roof was erected was so ingenious that
      it deserves to be explained. They procured two stout poles, about fifteen
      feet long, which they put at each end of the structure, binding each
      firmly in its place, and leaving at the top a fork, formed from the
      projecting stump of one of the severed branches. Across these, and resting
      on these forks, they laid their ridge-pole, and bound this firmly in its
      place. To make it still stronger, they set up a third support in the
      middle of the camp, and thus made the ridge-pole firm enough to bear the
      weight of any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they proceeded to lay a row of poles along from the eaves to
      the ridge-pole, and others again intersecting these. Thus they formed a
      framework close enough and strong enough to admit of brush being placed
      upon it, and this they proceeded to lay there after the manner of thatch.
      The roof was pretty steep, and the spruce brush was so smooth, and was
      laid on so compactly, that it could have resisted any ordinary rain storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of their task was easy enough, the roof and frame having
      been by far the most troublesome. One side was allotted to each, and the
      work was interweaving spruce brush along the stakes. The space was twelve
      feet long by six high. They began from the ground, and went upward; and at
      length this was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still an open space at each gable end, but it was their
      intention to leave windows here. Poles were fastened in such a way that a
      square space was left in each gable, which admitted an ample amount of
      light, and the remainder was filled in with brush, like the sides. The
      door, of course, had been attended to in the construction of the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been hard work, but they were all adepts at the business, and knew
      exactly how to do each thing. The consequence was, that by sundown their
      camp was all completed, and only needed a few finishing touches, which
      could very well be postponed till the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all sat down to their evening repast with the consciousness that they
      had passed a well-spent day. Solomon had done his duty, as usual, with a
      minute conscientiousness, and a painful care of the smallest details,
      which was evinced by the exquisite flavor of the oyster stew. The chief
      regret that they had was, that Arthur and Tom were not there to share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea none of them ventured to move. They were more utterly fagged out
      than they ever remembered to have been in the whole course of their lives.
      There had, of course, been times when they had been more exhausted, and
      Phil could tell a tale of weariness which might have shamed his present
      feelings; but for the fatigue resulting from sheer hard work, they never
      knew anything that had equalled this. Their hands were all covered with
      blisters and balsam, while an additional air of shabbiness had been given
      to them by new rents and tatters in their clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sunset they noticed that the wind was stronger and the sea rougher.
      The Petrel had moved also still farther in to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another night&rsquo;ll finish her,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;if this wind continues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll land,&rdquo; said Bart, thinking of Arthur and Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as to that,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it seems to me that they won&rsquo;t feel
      inclined to sail all night; and they&rsquo;ll land, if they only can; but the
      trouble is, they may find themselves off some coast where no landing can
      be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Bart, thoughtfully, &ldquo;that the coast is rough enough all
      along, for most of the way; but then, fortunately, this wind is off the
      land; so they&rsquo;ll be all right. The danger would be if it was in any other
      direction. As it is, the closer they keep in to the shore, the safer
      they&rsquo;ll be; and, in fact, the safest place for them would be close in
      under the highest cliffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that certainly is a consolation,&rdquo; said Bruce, with a sigh of
      relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a good deal bothered all the afternoon, for I noticed
      that the wind was rising. I rather think you&rsquo;re in the right of it, Bart,
      and I&rsquo;m glad enough that you thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;as long as the wind is this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The throuble is,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;they might have to go round some headland,
      and thin they&rsquo;d catch it, hot and heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they wouldn&rsquo;t try it if it was too rough,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d haul up
      ashore, and wait till the wind went down. The fact is, they&rsquo;ll do just as
      any of us would do in the same circumstances. Neither Arthur nor Tom is
      inclined to run any risks. They know that there&rsquo;s no hurry, that we&rsquo;ve got
      lots of provisions. They&rsquo;ve got a good supply, too, and so they&rsquo;ll take it
      easy. My opinion is, they both landed two or three hours ago, hauled up
      their boat high and dry, picked up some drift wood, and are at this moment
      sitting in front of a roaring fire, calmly discussing what had best be
      done to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This discussion about the fate of their two absent friends made them all
      feel quite at their ease once more, and soon after they went to bed inside
      of the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they found a pleasant surprise awaiting them, which had been devised
      by Solomon. He had taken the fat out of some of the jars of potted meat,
      and put it in two cups. In these he had ingeniously arranged floating
      wicks, and lighted them. So now, as the boys entered, they were surprised
      at a cheerful glow inside. At first they were alarmed, and thought the
      camp was on fire; but a second look showed them the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their camp now seemed very cheerful indeed. The ground was quite dry, and
      each one rolled himself up in his blanket, which formed their only
      preparation for bed. Here, reclining on the soft grass, with the green
      walls of their camp encircling them, they chatted pleasantly for a short
      time, and at length, one by one, dropped off into sound and refreshing
      slumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On awaking they all hurried forth. They found that the wind had increased,
      and must have been increasing all night. Close in under the shore the
      water was smooth enough, but a mile outside it began to roughen, and a
      white line of breakers shone along the base of the headland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the Petrel that now engaged all their attention. She had been
      forced in to within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the shore, and had evidently
      touched bottom, for she lay a little over on one side. She had reached a
      place where the sea felt the effect of the wind, and the waves broke over
      her decks. She rose and fell occasionally, with a slow, heavy movement, at
      the force of the waves that beat upon her. The shore immediately opposite
      the place where she had grounded was all white with foam, and it seemed as
      if the bottom where she touched might be strewn with rough, jagged rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard indeed was the resting-place to which the Petrel had come after so
      long a wandering!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked on in silence. They did not exactly lament the fate which
      seemed to impend over her, but, at the same time, they felt as though, in
      some way, it might be a disaster to themselves. For the Petrel, as long as
      she had floated, had served, at least, as a sort of signal by which any
      passing vessel might be attracted; whereas, if she were destroyed, their
      chance of rescue in that way grew less. They also felt that the large
      store of provisions and supplies on board might yet be needed; and in case
      of the unsuccessful return of Arthur and Tom, they might need to visit her
      once more. But now all hope of this seemed at an end. In this
      half-developed regret at her fate, there was, however, no thought of
      salvage; that subject was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast their attention was once more directed to the Petrel. Any
      further operations in the camp had now to be postponed, for the
      attractions of the imperilled ship were too engrossing to admit of lesser
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t we try to get nearer? We can work
      our way along at the top of the bank, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we can,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;At any rate, it&rsquo;s not very far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be worse than the upper part of that miserable brook,&rdquo; said
      Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an I&rsquo;d go on me hands and knees all the way, so I would, to git
      nearer to her,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coast that ran along terminated in the headland, between which and the
      cove it consisted of steep banks, at first wooded, and rough cliffs. The
      top of the bank all along was covered with trees, and seemed to offer no
      greater difficulties than any other part of the woods. The headland itself
      seemed over a mile away, and the Petrel was some distance inside of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      They thus resolved to go, and set forth at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be back in time for dinna,&rdquo; said Solomon, as they climbed up the steep
      bank to get to the top..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; was the reply, as they vanished into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decidedly rough walking. The ground was uneven, rising into mounds
      and depressed into hollows. Sometimes fallen trees lay before them; at
      other times underbrush so dense and so stubborn that a way could only be
      forced through with the most persevering effort. Besides, it was
      absolutely necessary to keep as near as possible to the edge of the cliff,
      for they all knew how easily they might be lost, if they once ventured out
      of sight of it. So they kept on, close by the brink, even though places
      occasionally appeared which seemed much easier to traverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they reached the place immediately opposite the Petrel. She lay
      within easy stone&rsquo;s throw. Before them the cliff went down with rough,
      jagged sides, and the shore at its foot was covered with masses of rock
      that had fallen there from the precipice. It was not more than sixty or
      seventy feet down. On this elevation, and at this distance out, they felt
      the full force of the blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Petrel had certainly grounded, and it was evident to them that the
      bottom was rough and irregular. She lay over on her side, her stern
      nearest to the shore. The bows were sunk under to the depth of about a
      foot, while the stern rose a little. She swayed backward and forward with
      a regular motion, and there was a dull, gringing, creaking noise, that
      came from her to their ears, and was plainly discernible through the noise
      of the surf on the rocks below. The sea at this point was quite heavy, and
      rolled over and over the doomed ship. The long waves came sweeping up at
      successive intervals, and at every stroke the Petrel would yield, and then
      slowly struggle back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how long she can stand this sort of thing,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long, I should think,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;but after all, the wind isn&rsquo;t very
      strong just yet, and if there are no rocks under her, she may hold out
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this wind grows to a gale, she&rsquo;s done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then it may not get any worse, and if it goes down, I&rsquo;d undertake to
      swim on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, of course, if it gets smooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to going out to the point?&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The point was not far away, and the woods were thinner. They reached it
      without much difficulty. Standing here an extensive scene came upon their
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left, the coast line ran on for a few miles, rough and rugged
      cliffs, with a crest of stunted trees. On the right, the coast line was
      what they had already seen. In front was the boundless sea, covered with
      foaming waves. At their feet the surf thundered in a line of foam, and
      tossed its spray high on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t altogether like the look of things,&rdquo; said Bruce, after a long and
      silent gaze upon the sea and the rough coast in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t fret,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Look, Bruce, close in to the shore under the
      cliffs: why, it&rsquo;s smooth enough there to paddle a raft in. They&rsquo;ll keep
      close in to the shore, and land whenever they want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only they might try to round a headland like that,&rdquo; said Bruce, pointing
      to a cliff which terminated the view towards the left, at the base of
      which there was a line of white foam; &ldquo;and if they did,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid neither Arthur nor Tom&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly, leaving the sentence unfinished.

      and Tom, on rounding the headland, kept on their course, following the
      line of the shore. The water was smooth, and the breeze continued
      moderate, yet fair. The sail worked well, the boat glided smoothly through
      the water, and they slipped on past the shore at a rate which was most
      gratifying to both of them. They kept away about a mile from the land, a
      distance which seemed to them to allow of a ready resort there in case of
      need, while at the same time it was far enough out to get the full benefit
      of the breeze, and maintain a sufficiently straight course. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The coast was most forbidding. Rugged cliffs arose, or rocky, sterile
      banks, crested with stunted spruce. Hour after hour passed by, and mile
      after mile of the coast slipped away behind them, but not the slightest
      sign appeared of human habitation or of human life; nothing but the same
      iron-bound shore, and the same unbroken solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time they came in sight of places which were more inviting.
      Sometimes there were shelving beaches, which appeared to be covered with
      sand or pebbles; at other times they saw coves, whose aspect was less
      forbidding than that of the bolder coast line; and on one occasion there
      was a small harbor, which, in comparison with the rest of the country, was
      decidedly inviting, and, if their errand had been less pressing, they
      would certainly have entered it, and explored the surrounding region. But,
      as it was, they passed on, noticing as they passed that here, as
      everywhere else, there was not a field, not a pasture, not a clearing;
      that there were no signs of cattle or of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the hours of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun attained its meridian, and the two voyagers thought of dinner. The
      provident care of Solomon had furnished them with everything that could be
      desired on such a trip as this, and the repast was not only abundant, but
      attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what speed we have been making,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five miles, I should think,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I; but, then, we can&rsquo;t be certain. There may be currents, or we
      may be deceived in our estimate. Let&rsquo;s say four, and then we&rsquo;ll feel
      certain. It&rsquo;s after twelve now; we left at six; that&rsquo;s six hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four miles an hour&mdash;little enough,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
      twenty-four miles. If this sort of thing can only be kept up, we&rsquo;ll get to
      St. Pierre in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing,&rdquo; said Arthur,&mdash;&ldquo;if it can only be kept up.
      But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a little too good to last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Tom, cheerily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make the best of it while we
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur&rsquo;s forebodings, though not based upon any ground of alarm, were,
      however, actually justified by the event, and not very long after. For
      scarcely had they finished their repast, when they became aware of a very
      serious increase in the wind. A series of puffs, which almost amounted to
      squalls, came down, and in a very short time the sea began to rise to a
      very unpleasant extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep in closer,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;fortunately the wind&rsquo;s off the land, and, if we can get
      in nearer, we&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not so easy to get in nearer. Tom, however, took a paddle,
      while Arthur held the boat as close to the wind as possible, and thus, in
      process of time, they drew her in far enough to get into smoother water.
      This was not accomplished without some trifling casualties: several waves
      dashed their spray into the boat, and they shipped one sea which was heavy
      enough to drench them both, and leave as much as a barrel full of salt
      water behind. This showed them what they might expect if they dared to
      keep too far away from the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now close in to the shore, and they proceeded onward slowly, but
      securely. It was not quite equal to their previous progress, but it was
      free from danger and inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;re going to have a turn of luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;re doing well enough,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;ll be sure to come to some headland, and there we&rsquo;ll stick,
      for we shan&rsquo;t be able to round it. This boat can&rsquo;t stand any sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll wait till the time comes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and not fret till
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for us,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that the wind&rsquo;s the way it is. If that was
      a lee shore, we&rsquo;d be done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if the wind had been any other way we shouldn&rsquo;t have started, you
      know,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and if it changes we&rsquo;ll go ashore and haul up&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t find a landing-place just here very easily. I don&rsquo;t think I
      ever saw a more rascally place in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather rough, I must confess,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll find a better
      place before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were within an eighth of a mile from the land. It rose there in high,
      rocky cliffs, crested, as usual, with stunted trees, and fragments of rock
      at its base.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems to run on for a long way ahead,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if behind that point ahead the
      land got better. It stands to reason that these cliffs can&rsquo;t extend
      forever. There must be places here and there where gullies occur&mdash;places
      where brooks run down, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I dare say; but I only hope we may get to some such a place before the
      wind changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is the wind going to change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I merely supposed a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I dare say the wind&rsquo;ll keep in this direction for ever so long yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sailed along slowly under these cliffs for about a couple of miles,
      and at length reached the point of which Arthur had spoken. They passed
      this, full of curiosity as to what lay beyond. They saw that the land here
      receded for a mile or two,&mdash;very gradually, however,&mdash;while
      several miles ahead it projected itself once more into the sea, and was
      terminated by a precipitous headland. These receding shores showed a
      different appearance from that of the cliffs which they had just been
      passing. They were wooded down to the water&rsquo;s edge, which they approached
      by a gentle declivity, while about two miles ahead they disclosed a wide
      area where there were no trees at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this was cultivated ground, cleared ground, or pasture, they could
      not very well make out; but they had not caught sight of it before they
      saw something which at once riveted their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a column of smoke!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to a settlement at last. Well, it&rsquo;s about
      time. Hurrah! We&rsquo;re all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;there must be some life about&mdash;though I can&rsquo;t
      see any sign of any settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, there must be a settlement somewhere about. We can&rsquo;t see it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There certainly must be people, for there is the smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The settlement is farther back; away from the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or perhaps behind that headland. I dare say there&rsquo;s a harbor there,
      and a fishing settlement. This may be some solitary house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solitary or not, it&rsquo;s all the same to us. It shows us that we have come
      near to human beings again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A straight course towards the place where the smoke arose would have drawn
      them into rough water; so they hugged the shore, and followed its curve,
      in order to avoid the danger. For a time the smoke was concealed from
      view; but at length, as they went on, it came into sight again, and
      appeared twice as near as when they had first seen it. Here they saw a
      beach, which ran away for a long distance; and they noticed now that the
      smoke itself seemed to rise from a point on the beach about a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;The smoke can&rsquo;t be from a house at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, some one has been making a fire on the beach. But it&rsquo;s all the same.
      It shows that people are living hereabouts, and that&rsquo;s all we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll soon know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should laugh if this place were to turn out to be Gaspé, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, there&rsquo;s no doubt about the place. It must be Newfoundland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation came from Arthur. He said no more, but pointed in
      silence, while Tom looked eagerly in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the beach, about a quarter of a mile away, they saw a moving figure. It
      was a man. He was running along with irregular steps, waving his arms in
      the air in a wild way, and evidently trying to attract their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      They at once headed the boat in nearer to the shore, so as to meet him as
      soon as possible. As they neared the shore the man neared them. The beach
      was smooth, and his staggering, irregular steps could not have been caused
      by the rough ground, while his wild gesticulations seemed unaccountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be drunk,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat grounded, and the next moment the man reached the spot. No sooner
      had he come up to them than he fell on his knees, and, grasping the bows
      of the boat, bowed his head, and sobbed convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw, as he came up, that he was pale and emaciated. He was panting
      heavily from his exertions. He wore a flannel shirt and canvas trousers.
      He looked like a common sailor from some ship, and not at all like a
      fisherman or farmer. The boys stared at him without saying one single
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the man rose and looked at them with a searching and curious
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple o? youngsters,&rdquo; said he at last, as though speaking to himself.
      &ldquo;Queer, too&mdash;youngsters! Say, boys, is your ship near by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, from over there,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;The fact is, we got ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got ashore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and we&rsquo;ve come here to look up some settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got ashore! settlement!&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;d like to go, as soon as possible, to the
      nearest settlement. We want to engage a schooner to go back with us and
      get our friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the man stared at them for a few moments in a wild way, and then
      burst forth into laughter so strange and so wild that both the boys felt
      uncomfortable. Tom began to think that he was not drunk, but insane, and
      felt sorry that they had allowed the boat to touch the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the man stopped, and looked at them with a totally different
      expression. He looked at them fixedly, and there was on his face a certain
      pity and commiseration which struck them forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he at length, in a gentle voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on the lookout for a
      settlement, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look at me. Now look at all this country. Well, I&rsquo;m the only
      settler here. I&rsquo;m the only settler you&rsquo;ll ever find here, if you sail a
      hundred years. Do you know where you&rsquo;ve got to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we thought it was Newfoundland,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Gaspé,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at them with a solemn face for some time, and said not a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boys! poor boys!&rdquo; he murmured at last; &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps they was worse off&rsquo;n
      I was. An air you all alone, boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ve left our friends some, miles back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, an you thought you was on Newfoundland coast, or Gaspé, an you goes
      off to hunt for help, an you leaves your friends. Well, now, have they got
      lots to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots?&rdquo; repeated the man, with some energy. &ldquo;Lots, now, railly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty&mdash;enough to last them for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An so you comes off for help. Why did they let you youngsters go? Why
      didn&rsquo;t the men go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;re all boys,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s queer, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A kind of pleasure party,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An so you thinks you&rsquo;ve got onto Newfoundland or Gaspé,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why? Where are we? Can you tell us? And who are you? and what are
      you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Look at me. Can&rsquo;t you see what I be? Do I look like a
      gentleman farmer? Is this the country for a emigrant? Me!&rdquo; he repeated,
      with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;Poor boys! poor boys! Why, I&rsquo;m jest like you. I&rsquo;m
      ship-wracked&mdash;on&rsquo;y I knows where I be, an that&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n you do, it
      seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shipwrecked!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wracked&mdash;the worst sort; an this here country&mdash;so you
      think it&rsquo;s Newfoundland or Gaspé? Well&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst place in the world&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is; a place where there
      ain&rsquo;t no hope, and there ain&rsquo;t no life. It&rsquo;s only death that a man can
      find here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;Tell us what place it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked at them both, one after the other, with a solemn face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I been ship wracked,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an I been here more&rsquo;n a fortnight; an
      this here place is&mdash;Anticosti!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anticosti!&rdquo; exclaimed both the boys, exchanging glances of horror, while
      a feeling of despair came over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;this here country&rsquo;s Anticosti&mdash;un woe to the
      poor wretch that&rsquo;s cast ashore here. For there ain&rsquo;t no life here, an
      there ain&rsquo;t no hope, an there ain&rsquo;t no food; an the only thing a man can
      do is to lie down an die as fast as he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed. The boys felt utterly overwhelmed. They had all
      heard enough about Anticosti to make the name one of dread, and to
      surround it with the darkest gloom and the most formidable terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought,&rdquo; said Arthur, at length, to the man, who seemed to be lost in
      his own thoughts, &ldquo;we supposed that we were on the coast of Newfoundland,
      somewhere between Cape Ray and Fortune&rsquo;s Bay; so we started off to sail
      along the coast in search of a settlement, and if we couldn&rsquo;t find any we
      intended to go to St. Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Anticosti,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Arthur, gravely, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll suppose it is. So much the more
      need for us to help our friends. You appear to have had a hard time of it;
      but you&rsquo;re a sailor, and we are not. You can help us. It seems to me that
      you can do a great deal for us. I think we had better keep to our plan,
      and try to reach the nearest settlement. If it is St. Pierre, or the Bay
      of Islands, or any other place, perhaps you can tell us. At any rate, you
      can sail the boat, and we can&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve got lots of provisions here; so
      you&rsquo;d better come with us, and help us to reach some place where we can
      get assistance for our friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Arthur was saying this, the man stared at him most intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he at last, as Arthur ceased, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re about the pluckiest lot
      in the way of boys that I&rsquo;ve come across for some time. All I can say is,
      you needn&rsquo;t beat round the bush with me. You&rsquo;ve saved my life, and so
      you&rsquo;ll find that Dick Bailey is yours till death. All you&rsquo;ve got to do,
      boys, is to tell what you want done, and I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;if it can be
      done. But fust and foremost, let me tell you &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no use tryin
      to get any further in that there boat this day, for the wind&rsquo;s risin, and
      you&rsquo;d best come ashore till it blows over. We&rsquo;ll take the boat up high and
      dry out of harm&rsquo;s way, and then we can talk over what we&rsquo;d best do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go any farther to-day?&rdquo; asked Arthur, in a disappointed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bailey,&mdash;&ldquo;no, you can&rsquo;t go either for&rsquo;ard or back&rsquo;ard, for
      it&rsquo;s a head wind one way, and the other way is barred by that there pint.
      So, as I said afore, you&rsquo;d better land. We&rsquo;ll draw the boat up high an dry
      out of harm&rsquo;s way, and we&rsquo;ll wait till to-morrer. By that time there&rsquo;ll be
      a change for the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Arthur and Tom got out, and the three drew the boat up as far as
      they could upon the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s out of harm&rsquo;s way, unless a sou&rsquo;-wester
      comes; an if it does, we can move her up further. But there ain&rsquo;t no
      chance of that. And now, boys, hain&rsquo;t you got something to give a poor
      feller to eat that&rsquo;s been starvin for a fortnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this appeal Arthur and Tom at once laid open all their stores,
      producing biscuit, ham, potted meats, and all the other articles of food
      which comprised their sea stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the shipwrecked Bailey ate ravenously; ate, in fact, as though he
      would never be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had,&rdquo; said he, as soon as he found time to speak in the intervals
      of eating,&mdash;&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had not to say a reg&rsquo;lar meal for three weeks,
      which accounts for my present ravenosity, an hopin you&rsquo;ll excuse it, young
      gents.&rdquo;

       style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T length Bailey&rsquo;s hunger seemed somewhat
      appeased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a thinkin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as how we&rsquo;d better take these here
      victuals to some place where it&rsquo;ll be more under cover, and handy for us
      about tea time. If you like, I&rsquo;ll take them to my den.&rdquo; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t we roll it farther up? This barrel&rsquo;s too heavy to take any
      distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo; know but what you&rsquo;re more&rsquo;n half right. I didn&rsquo;t think of
      the bar&rsquo;l. Leastways, we can put it further up, out of the reach of any
      surf, and cover it with the sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can take with us as much as we may be likely to want,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t no fear of anybody stealin the things
      here; and as the wind ain&rsquo;t likely to turn yet a while, I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose
      there&rsquo;ll be any danger of surf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few further precautions, so as to secure the boat and the contents
      from any possible harm, Bailey set off to show the boys his &ldquo;den.&rdquo; They
      walked along the beach for about half a mile, and then stopped at a place
      where a high rock jutted out. Behind this there was a recess about twenty
      feet above the beach, formed by a fissure in the rock. A huge mass
      overhead shut it in, and formed a sort of roof; while the lower portion
      had been filled up by crumbled fragments. Over this rough floor Bailey had
      spread spruce brush, ferns, and mosses, so that it was soft enough to lie
      down on. The whole recess was about eight feet deep, six feet wide, and
      six feet high. Immediately outside a fire was burning, and from this came
      the smoke which had first attracted their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep that there burnin,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;night and day, an I&rsquo;ve kept it a
      burnin for the last fortnight. There&rsquo;s drift-wood enough along the beach
      here, though every day I have to go further away to get it. Wal, there&rsquo;s
      wood enough on the island, if it comes to that, only &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t easy gittin
      it up in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked around with deep interest, and with varied feelings. They
      saw outside, by the fire, heaps of shells, which seemed to have been
      burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;them&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve had to eat, every bite, since I
      landed here. They do to keep body and soul together, but they ain&rsquo;t much
      account. I&rsquo;d give a bushel any day for one good biscuit. What I&rsquo;ve jest
      eat seems to have made a man of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys were silent for some time, and at length Arthur asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you happen to get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo; said Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin at the beginnin. Wal, you see, about five weeks ago I shipped
      aboard the Petrel, at Quebec&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what?&rdquo; cried Arthur and Tom, in the greatest wonder and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ship Petrel,&rdquo; said Bailey. &ldquo;Why, what of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Petrel!&rdquo; cried Arthur. &ldquo;What, the ship Petrel, of Liverpool-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there&rsquo;s the identical craft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;and,&rdquo; stammered Tom, in his excitement, &ldquo;was&mdash;was
      her captain&rsquo;s name Henry Hall? and&mdash;and was she loaded with timber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t she get water-logged?&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and didn&rsquo;t the captain and crew all leave her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bailey stared at the boys with astonishment fully equal to their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know all about her,&rdquo; said he, slowly; &ldquo;and how you larned all
      that beats me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the very ship that we got wrecked on, too,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;we were sailing about, and found her adrift, and all as
      comfortable as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We tried to be salvors,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;and we were left on board to take
      care of her while our captain went off in the schooner for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he anchored her, and the anchor didn&rsquo;t hold,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we drifted all about the gulf,&rdquo; continued Arthur, &ldquo;and were out in
      the most horrible gales that ever were, till finally we got ashore here.&rdquo;
       The boys poured out this information in the most rapid manner possible
      upon the astounded Bailey, who now seemed fairly struck dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;in the Petrel!&rdquo; he exclaimed, at length, in slow and perplexed
      tones. &ldquo;You&mdash;you adrift in that water-logged craft! and thrown by
      that there ship here on Anticosti!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, briskly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it.&rdquo; Bailey raised his hand
      slowly to his head, and scratched it solemnly, raising his eyes at the
      same time, and fixing them upon empty space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These here two young coves in the Petrel! and hev ashore on Anticosti!&rdquo;
       he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;and now tell us all about how you got here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bailey started, and looked at each of them silently and solemnly; then he
      looked away, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, at last, &ldquo;this here&mdash;doos&mdash;beat&mdash;my&mdash;grandmother!
      Wal, I&rsquo;ll tell my story, an then I&rsquo;ll listen to yourn, an we&rsquo;ll compare
      notes, an in that way we&rsquo;ll grad&rsquo;ly get the hang of it; for jest now, as
      things is, I&rsquo;m dumfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; continued Bailey, after a pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start afresh. I shipped
      then, as I was a sayin, as able seaman, aboard the Petrel. She was loaded
      down deep with timber, an badly loaded, too, for as she lay in the stream
      at Quebec, she had a list ever so far over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was overly sober when I was took on board, an I don&rsquo;t
      think any of the other men was overly sober, neither; at any rate, the
      first thing I knows, I finds myself thirty mile below Quebec, aboard the
      Petrel, that had a list to one side that would almost let a man foot it up
      her masts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing we all does, we all begins to kick up a dust. The mate he
      swears we ain&rsquo;t goin to sail the ship. Crank? Why, crank ain&rsquo;t the word!
      Wal, the captain he tells us we&rsquo;re gettin up mutiny, and warns us. And we
      tells him to look at the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, things goes on somehow, and we gets down the river further, we
      grumblin all the way and the mate a swearin. One night she drifts nigh to
      the shore and touches. We gets her off somehow; but she got a bad sprain,
      and begins to leak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, we all growls and grumbles, and won&rsquo;t touch the pumps; and the
      captain he threatens, and the mate he rows and swears, and the captain he
      vows, leak or no leak, he&rsquo;ll put that there ship across the Atlantic. At
      last things grows worse, and the mate one day puts a couple of us in the
      bilboes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that only makes things worse; and by that time we was in the gulf,
      and rough weather comes on, and none of us would touch a line. So the
      captain he knocks under, and lets the men go, and promises us a glass of
      grog all round if we&rsquo;ll bear a hand at the pumps. But we insists on
      putting the deck-load overboard first. The captain wouldn&rsquo;t do it, though,
      for ever so long; till at last the wind blew a gale, and the cranky vessel
      plunged under so, and strained and twisted so, that at last he was glad
      enough to do it of his own accord. So we all goes to work in the midst of
      that there gale, and puts every stick over. They wasn&rsquo;t much&mdash;only
      deals, and easy handled. It was timber below, and if it had been timber on
      deck, we couldn&rsquo;t have done it nohow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that gale went on, and another followed, and we all pumped away for
      dear life, but didn&rsquo;t do much. It had got to be a little too late; and
      what with the first touch on the rocks, and the straining and twisting
      afterwards, the leak got to be a little the biggest I ever did see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it went from bad to worse. We all worked at last like the old boy. No
      need then for the captain to encourage us. We worked for dear life without
      bein told. But the leak gained steadily, and the storm increased. At last
      every rag of sail was blown off, and the ship was water-logged, and we all
      had to take refuge in the riggin. We saw what was comin in time to get the
      boats up out of harm&rsquo;s way, for the water was rollin over the deck so that
      you couldn&rsquo;t tell which was the ship and which was the sea. We were for
      puttin off and abandonin of her; but the captain he swore she never could
      sink, bein timber-laden, and said the storm would soon blow over, and we&rsquo;d
      put into Miramichi. So we hung on as long as we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last the vessel strained so that we all was sure and certain that she
      was goin to pieces; so we determined to save ourselves; so we got down the
      long-boat, and managed, one by one, to get into her as she floated to
      leeward, and then begged the captain and mate to follow. The mate seemed
      half inclined, but the captain was obstinate. He swore he would stick to
      the ship, and save her yet. He begged us to come back, and told us she
      would float till doomsday. But we swore she was break-in up, and told him
      she couldn&rsquo;t hang together one day more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it was, all this time we didn&rsquo;t know where we was. There was
      fog and heavy-gales, and the captain hadn&rsquo;t taken no reckonin for weeks.
      We wanted to git off the wreck before she got onto the rocks. As for the
      captain and mate, they had the cutter, and a couple of the men staid
      behind to take off the cutter, and the captain and mate, too, if they
      should come to their senses, leastways the mate. And what became of them
      four I hain&rsquo;t no idee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then we dropped off, and went away in the long-boat. We hadn&rsquo;t no
      idee where we was, and couldn&rsquo;t tell the pints of the compass. We thought
      the best thing would be to run before the wind, since we didn&rsquo;t know any
      better way, and we knew we was somewhere in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and
      would fetch up at last somewheres. So we let her run, and kept a sharp
      lookout, or tried to, though &rsquo;twan&rsquo;t no use at night, for what with
      the darkness and the fog, the nights was that dark you couldn&rsquo;t see the
      nose before your face. Well, that&rsquo;s all. The only thing more that I know
      is this&mdash;that one night I was sound asleep, and was waked up by a
      tremenjous yell, and found myself in the water. The boat had been thrown
      on rocks or surf, and had capsized. I struggled, and at last found bottom,
      and rushed blindly along, I couldn&rsquo;t see where, till I got to dry ground.
      And it was this here beach; and afterwards, as I found out how the wind
      was blowin, and put this an that together, I concluded that this was
      Anticosti, and now I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So ended Bailey&rsquo;s narrative. A long conversation followed. The boys were
      anxious to know why he felt so sure that it was Anticosti, and Bailey
      described his theory of the position of the Petrel at the time he left
      her, and the course which the boat must have taken in such a wind. He also
      felt sure, from the character of the coast and the country, that it was
      this place, and no other. Then the boys gave a minute account of their own
      adventures. Bailey was most struck by the captain&rsquo;s paper found in the
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he stood it as long as he could; but I dar say, arter we
      cleared out, he begun to feel a little shaky. And that thar ship did shake
      herself up in a way that beat everythin I ever see in all my born days. I
      was as sure that she was breakin up as I was of my own name. So the
      captain he thought, no doubt, that it wan&rsquo;t wuth while to die for the sake
      of an old timber ship, or p&rsquo;raps the mate and the sailors pressed him, and
      so off he goes; or p&rsquo;raps some passing vessel hove in sight, and took him
      off. But only think of you youngsters happenin on board, and goin through
      the same identical fortin that I went through, and then us meetin this way
      in Anticosti! It doos&mdash;beat&mdash;my&mdash;grandmother! It&mdash;doos&mdash;railly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question now arose what was best to be done. Of course the fact that
      this was Anticosti changed the whole state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see if this was railly Newfoundland,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;we might sail
      east, and event&rsquo;ly git to some settlement; but if we try that now, we&rsquo;ll
      have to go all along past the worst coast in the world, and then we&rsquo;d get
      to East Pint; and what then? Why, the gulf. So we&rsquo;ve got to turn about,
      and go back in the other direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? West?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, away west, or sou&rsquo;-west. I&rsquo;ve heard tell of some settlement at West
      Pint, the other end of the island; but I hain&rsquo;t no idee whether it&rsquo;s kep
      up yet or not. At any rate, there&rsquo;s Gaspé. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t far off. We can crawl
      along the shore, and then cut across to Gaspé, and get help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll go back first to where we left the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course, that&rsquo;s the first thing; and then your vyge ends, and we&rsquo;ve got to
      arrange a fresh one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, can we start to-day?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day? No, sir! Look at me! Why, I&rsquo;d give anythin to git away from this
      here place! Think of me here for two long weeks, livin on shell fish,
      pacin up and down the beach, and keepin my signal-fire a burnin all the
      time, and feelin myself every day gradooly growin ravin mad! Think what
      I&rsquo;ve ben an suffered here! Yet I wouldn&rsquo;t leave to-day, &rsquo;cos it&rsquo;s
      goin to blow harder, and that there cockle-shell don&rsquo;t do to beat against
      a wind like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t we row?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain&rsquo;t got no oars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are those in the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them things! Them&rsquo;s poles, or paddles; do to push the boat a little way
      through smooth water, but not with the wind this way. No; we&rsquo;ve got to
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur and Tom both felt the force of this, and urged the point no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;how you managed to light a fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, with my jackknife and a bit of flint,&rdquo; said Bailey. &ldquo;No trouble to get
      flint hereabouts. I got some cotton wool out of the paddin of my collar,
      and some dry moss, and coaxed some sparks into a blaze. O, you give me a
      knife, and I&rsquo;ll draw fire out of any stone anywhars. The night I was drove
      ashore, I crept somewhar under the cliff, and staid there till mornin, and
      in the mornin the first thing I doos is to kindle a fire. I found the
      drift-wood, and this seemed to be the best place. Sea shells isn&rsquo;t the
      best fare in the world, and sick am I of all sorts and kinds of shell
      fish; but glad was I when I lit on them that first day, when I walked
      about nearly starved. If it hadn&rsquo;t ben for them thar shells it would ha&rsquo;
      ben all over with me. That&rsquo;s so. And this here den wasn&rsquo;t a bad place,
      considerin. In fact, I ben a lucky man in some things, seein that this is
      Anticosti, and fust and foremost, that I got off with my life; for every
      one of the rest was drownded, and I&rsquo;ve never seen even a splinter of the
      boat since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of this gloomy event reduced Bailey for a time to
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon passed away. The wind increased. The sea grew rougher, and
      every hour served to increase the impossibility of a return that day. But
      the boys had already resigned themselves to this, and therefore awaited
      the evening, and looked forward to the night with calmness and in
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset the evening repast was spread out, and Bailey showed his usual
      ravenous appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears to me, boys,&rdquo; said he, apologetically, &ldquo;jest as if I
      couldn&rsquo;t ever git enough to eat again. You&rsquo;ll have to make allowances for
      a man as has been starvin for three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After tea they made their preparations for the night. First they went to
      see that the boat was safe, and to make doubly sure, they hauled her
      farther up the beach. Then they collected a quantity of drift-wood, with
      which they replenished their fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar,&rdquo; said Bailey, &ldquo;if so be as any vessel does pass by, they&rsquo;ll be sure
      to see this here light, and they&rsquo;ll know precious well as how some
      unfortunate coves is shipwrecked here, and is a signalin for help. But,
      misfortunately, I ben a lookin for-ard every night for help, and it never
      would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your signal that drew us in,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;It was a success by
      day, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked and meditated for another hour or so, and watched the blazing
      flames till they were tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they all spread themselves out in Bailey&rsquo;s &ldquo;den,&rdquo; and fell asleep.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>AILEY&rsquo;S den was a
      particularly well sheltered recess in the rock, open to no wind, except a
      sou&rsquo;-wester. The wind that blew while Bailey and his guests slumbered
      inside, came from the north-west, and therefore the sleepers knew nothing
      of it. Out in the sea, indeed, the waters felt its power, and the foaming
      waves on the following morning told them the story of the night; but
      during that night they knew nothing at all about it. Far down the side of
      the cliff, under the rocky precipice, out of the way of the wind, the
      occupants of Bailey&rsquo;s den slumbered on the soft spruce brush and softer
      moss. All night long the fire burned outside, for Bailey had piled up the
      fuel generously, yet carefully, and had so arranged it, by making
      alternate layers of green wood and dry, that it would burn all night long,
      and yet send forth sufficient flame to be visible at sea. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and the wind and sea had gone down. Upon rising, the
      denizens of Bailey&rsquo;s den looked forth upon the water, and saw that it was
      very much the same as it had been on the preceding day. At this Arthur and
      Tom shook their heads, but Bailey was sanguine, and spoke encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind has hauled round a pint or two,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if it was to come round a little more; and if so, it&rsquo;ll be all
      right for us. A moderate north or north-east wind&rsquo;ll be jest the cheese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They now replenished the fire, after which they sat down to their
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you got all this out of the Petrel,&rdquo; said Bailey. &ldquo;Well, only think!
      Why, what gormandizers them captains an mates in the cabin must be&mdash;feedin
      on potted meats! an only think what we eats before the mast! Hard tack,
      salt junk, an dish-water, that&rsquo;s what we eats before the mast; but aft, my
      gentlemen won&rsquo;t be satisfied with nothin less than Yorkshire game pie, and
      Oxford sassage&mdash;and, what&rsquo;s this?&mdash;Bolony sassage, an all them
      other condyments what you&rsquo;ve got done up in them there tin pots. Wall,
      they&rsquo;re precious good eatin on a desert island, whatever they be in a
      ship&rsquo;s cabin, only they seem most too good for the likes of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Why, you have a better right to them than we have;
      for we haven&rsquo;t any right at all. And, as to the Petrel, if you can manage
      to save her, I hereby agree to deliver up and surrender to you. all my
      right, title, and interest in and to any part or portion of the so-called
      salvage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; said Tom, chiming in with the utmost gravity; &ldquo;and hereby
      make known by these presents, to all whom it may concern, and anything to
      the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bailey was evidently much impressed by these legal formulas. He bowed very
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant, young gents, and my &rsquo;umble dooty to both of you;
      but, at the same time, I don&rsquo;t want any more&rsquo;n fair an honest wages, and,
      if so be as you ain&rsquo;t in the position to give it, why, well and good, says
      I; but, if so be as you can, why, I&rsquo;ll take what&rsquo;s fair, and right, and
      lawful, and no more&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this point this interesting conversation was abruptly terminated by
      a loud cry from Tom. His eyes were fixed upon the sea, and were fascinated
      by something there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sail! a sail!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A sail! O, a sail! Look, look, look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur and Bailey sprang to their feet, and looked in the direction where
      Tom was pointing. Tom seized the spy-glass, wrhich they had brought into
      the den, and examined more closely, while Arthur and Bailey watched the
      distant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, on the distant sea, several miles away, a sail appeared,
      unmistakably. It was a schooner, and she was not more than five miles
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s heading away from us,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s going away, out to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hasty,&rdquo; said Bailey; &ldquo;she may p&rsquo;raps be only beatin up agin
      this here wrind. It&rsquo;s a head wind for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it may turn out so,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now watched in silence for some time longer. The schooner held on her
      way steadily. At length she tacked, and, wearing round, headed towards the
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed it!&rdquo; said Bailey, triumphantly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a coastin along, and is
      beatin up agin the wind. Just hand us that there glass for a minute, if
      you please, and let us git a squint at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom handed the glass to Bailey, who took it, and looked at the schooner
      long and carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he returned it to Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fisher,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;a Yankee
      fisher. I knows the cut of her jib; there&rsquo;s no mistakin her. You don&rsquo;t
      find any of yer Province fishermen git up such a turnout as that there.
      Why, she&rsquo;s a cross between the best class of Liverpool pilot-boat and a
      nobleman&rsquo;s yacht; and I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a pilot-boat or a yacht
      afloat that can lick that there fisherman in a fair race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur now took the glass, and looked at her long and earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Tom,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;m thinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it&rsquo;s the very thought that I had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? The Fawn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all nonsense. I suppose all the Yankee fishermen, or, at
      any rate, a great many, are just like the Fawn; but, at any rate, wouldn&rsquo;t
      it be fun if it should turn out to be her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too much to hope for,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be fun enough for me
      if she only takes us off&mdash;if she only sees us. Hadn&rsquo;t we better pile
      on more fuel, Bailey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no use. The fire&rsquo;s makin as much smoke as it can, an
      that&rsquo;s the best thing by daytime. If that there vessel&rsquo;s beatin up the
      coast, she&rsquo;s bound to see us on the next tack, if she don&rsquo;t see us now;
      and it&rsquo;ll only take three more tacks to bring her right opposite&mdash;Hallo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An abrupt exclamation terminated Bailey&rsquo;s remarks. He seized the glass
      without a word of apology, and took a hasty glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a histin an a lowerin of the flag! They&rsquo;re a signalizing, as sure
      as I&rsquo;m a born sinner! and to us! Hooray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Bailey shouted, quite beside himself, and then dropping the
      spy-glass, at the imminent risk of its destruction, he seized a pole that
      lay near, and scattered the fire about in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0325.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tryin to answer their signals,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They see us! They know
      that were a signalizin to them, and they&rsquo;re a tellin us that they&rsquo;ll be
      along! Hooray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schooner now tacked, and stood out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bailey; &ldquo;the next tack&rsquo;ll bring her nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reassured the boys, who did not like even the appearance of
      desertion. They watched her now in silence, and at length had the
      gratification of seeing her taking her next tack, and standing in towards
      the shore. This time she was very much nearer. Bailey rushed off, and
      gathered a quantity of dry spruce twigs and moss. As the schooner neared
      the shore, her flag rose and fell rapidly, and the report of a rifle
      sounded over the waters. At this Bailey flung his moss and spruce twigs
      upon the fire, and a vast cloud of smoke shot up, intermingled with sparks
      and flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gradooly a comin to a understandin,&rdquo; said Bailey, as he rubbed his
      hands in immense glee, and watched the schooner. &ldquo;And I do believe that
      the next tack&rsquo;ll bring her here. Boys, let&rsquo;s get ready with the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Bailey hurried down, followed by the boys. They hurried as
      fast as possible to the boat, and began to launch her. As she was
      uncommonly high and dry, this was a work of time; but it was at length
      accomplished, and the boat was afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was still off the land, to a certain extent, and the water had
      become far smoother. Besides, for a quarter of a mile or so from the land,
      it had never been much affected by the wind. They were too eager to wait,
      and so in a short time the sail was up, and Bailey, at the stern, headed
      the boat so as to meet the schooner on her return tack. As the wind caught
      the sail, the boat moved through the water, at first slowly, but gradually
      more swiftly. While the boat moved out, the schooner seemed to be sailing
      away, and leaving them behind; but this gave them no trouble, for they
      knew that before long she would wear round, and come to meet them. And so,
      with eager eyes, they watched her, and waited impatiently for the moment
      when she would turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Arthur gave a cry, and pointed down the coast. There, as they
      looked, to their great amazement, they saw another sail, far away,
      emerging from the land, and standing out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall&mdash;this&mdash;doos&mdash;beat&mdash;my&mdash;grandmother!&rdquo; cried
      Bailey. &ldquo;Or, in other words, boys, it never rains but it pours. We&rsquo;ll have
      the whole fishing fleet yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur and Tom said nothing. Tom seized the glass, and looked for a few
      minutes. Then he handed it to Arthur in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked for some time most earnestly and most curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s another vessel in the world like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very idea that I had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Not the Antelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the Antelope&mdash;her own very old self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Antelope!&rdquo; cried Bailey. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it. If it is her, then it&rsquo;s
      all explained. So he&rsquo;s come arter you&mdash;has he? So that&rsquo;s it. Wal,
      it&rsquo;s the least he could do, arter gittin you into such a precious scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s only a fancy. It mayn&rsquo;t be her, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but to my mind, it&rsquo;s more likely to be her than any one else. No one
      but a friend, in search of a friend, would ever think of beatin up this
      here way along the coast of Anticosti. That&rsquo;s my idee.&rdquo; This assurance of
      Bailey&rsquo;s tended to strengthen the idea which the boys had formed. After
      all, it was not impossible; nay, they thought it was not even improbable;
      for had they not been on the lookout for this very Antelope? and what
      vessel was more likely to come after them than this one? and why should
      she not come even to Anticosti?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she comes!&rdquo; cried Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fishing schooner. She was tacking. She wore round easily and
      gracefully, and headed straight towards them. They saw her draw nearer and
      nearer every moment, her bows rising, and tossing the water aside in
      showers of spray. They also stood boldly out now, for Bailey was at the
      helm, and was a far different sailor from Arthur or Tom. The little boat
      plunged soon into the rough water, and occasionally a torrent of foam
      dashed on board; but this was nothing, for all their eyes and all their
      thoughts were centred upon the approaching schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they met&mdash;the schooner driving through the sea under a
      cloud of canvas. There was a man at the bow&mdash;a well-known form&mdash;the
      form of Captain Tobias Ferguson. The graceful Fawn wore round; the boat
      came up; a line was thrown, and Bailey seized it. The boys clambered up
      her sides, and the instant they reached her deck, they found themselves
      seized by Ferguson, who said, in a voice broken by agitation,&mdash;&ldquo;Hooray!
      We&rsquo;ve got&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got you&mdash;at&mdash;at last! Where are the
      others? Why didn&rsquo;t they come off too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;They are all safe in a cove about twenty miles
      west of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a torrent of questions from Ferguson, which the boys
      answered. Their answers brought peace to his soul, for it appeared that he
      had been full of terror at the coming of these two, and two only, and had
      feared that they were bringing some disastrous tidings about the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was towed astern. Bailey was welcomed right royally, as was
      befitting one whom the boys introduced as their friend. At length the mind
      of Captain Tobias Ferguson was at rest; and the Fawn, rounding on another
      tack, stood out to sea, on her way towards the cove, where the rest of the
      party were encamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told us how you heard about us,&rdquo; said Arthur, as soon as
      he had a chance to ask a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson seized his arm, and pointed over the water to the sail that
      Arthur and Tom had already noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that schooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that tub, that wash-basin, that horse-trough, anything but a
      schooner. Well, do you know what that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Antelope?&rdquo; suggested Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s what she is called by her commander&mdash;that old woman,
      Mrs. Corbet, Mrs. Captain Corbet&mdash;old woman! Why, I can find fifty
      old women down our way that would take better care of a vessel than him&mdash;<i>her</i>,
      I mean. Well, boys, I was at Magdalen Islands when Mrs. Corbet came there
      in her wash-tub. I felt uneasy about you; knew something had happened;
      asked him&mdash;<i>her</i>, I mean&mdash;all about it; but Mrs. Corbet
      wouldn&rsquo;t answer. Well, I followed her. I was bound to see what had become
      of you. And where do you think that old woman went? Where? Why, to
      Miramichi! Well, I followed her there and back, and come up to her, to
      find her in the middle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, at her wit&rsquo;s end; for
      she had come there thinking that you would be anchored there, and waiting
      for her. Now, what do you think of that for an Old Woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys were very much surprised at this, and questioned him more
      closely. At first they thought that he was too hard on the venerable
      captain; but when they learned how the venerable captain had actually gone
      all the way to Miramichi, leaving them in their perilous position, they
      thought that the V. C., aforesaid, had gone too far, and that he merited
      all the contumely which Ferguson heaped so lavishly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody else,&rdquo; he continued,&mdash;&ldquo;anybody else but me, Tobias Ferguson,
      would simply have gone mad at trying to keep that old woman and her tub in
      sight. It&rsquo;s taken two days to do what might have been done in one. I&rsquo;ve
      sailed back a dozen times to keep her in sight; and look at her now! There
      she is, losing as much as she gains at every tack; standing still, as I&rsquo;m
      a living sinner. I sailed off, that very day I was telling you about, for
      Anticosti, and got to East Point. There I waited for Mrs. Corbet,
      inspecting the coast at odd times, and it was nearly the end of the next
      day before she came up; and even then I had to sail back ever so far to
      find her. Then we began to beat up along the coast, against the wind,
      watching all the time, not only the shore, but Mrs. Corbet. And there she
      is! At any rate, I won&rsquo;t bother about her any longer. I&rsquo;ll hurry up to the
      cove to get the rest of the boys, and let Mrs. Corbet come along as well
      as her venerable limbs&rsquo;ll carry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you know so well that we had drifted to Anticosti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for various reasons. Partly because I found out from Mrs. Corbet
      all about her crazy experiment at anchoring the ship; partly because I
      understood the general set of the tide; partly because I knew how the wind
      had been; but chiefly, I may say, because I had a presentiment all along
      that you were bound to get ashore on the worst place in all the gulf;
      which was Anticosti, and no other place. I knowed it. I was sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Fawn was careering through the waters. The boys had no
      regret at leaving Bailey&rsquo;s den, even though a number of cans of meat had
      been left behind. Bailey was on the broad grin, and felt no homesickness
      whatever. Arthur and Tom could not help contrasting the Fawn with the
      Antelope, greatly to the disadvantage of the latter, and began to think
      that in choosing Captain Corbet for their guide, they had made a mistake.
      But all these thoughts were swallowed up in the one great thought of the
      deliverance which they were bringing to their friends in the cove&mdash;a
      deliverance so much better than anything which they had hoped for, since
      it was in the form of old familiar friends, and not through the medium of
      strangers. Even the Antelope, and the much-maligned Corbet, as they
      followed far behind, seemed like additional elements in their joy.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>UT on the headland the boys stood
      watching. Bruce was sad and preoccupied. The others gazed uneasily upon
      the rough water. Could Arthur and Tom ever sail the boat through such a
      sea? That was the question which occurred to every one, and every one felt
      in his own heart that it was impossible. The prospect was not pleasant.
      They could only hope that the boys had gained the shore, and were waiting
      there till the wind might blow over. With this hope they tried to
      encourage Bruce, who showed more depression than the rest, and blamed
      himself several times for not insisting on going in Arthur&rsquo;s place.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they went back to the place where the Petrel lay. On reaching it
      they found that a marked change had taken place. Thus far, though low in
      the water, she had always preserved a certain symmetry of outline; and to
      those who might stand on her deck in fine weather and smooth water she
      seemed quite uninjured. But now her decks appeared to be burst open; she
      seemed broken in two. Bow and stern were low under water, while amidships
      she was above it. The mainmast inclined forward, and the foremast sloped
      back so far that they almost touched. Where she had parted asunder the
      planks of the decks had also started, and as the waves rolled over her,
      every new assault increased the ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s hogged,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s worse than hogged,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s completely broken in two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fallen upon some ridge of rock,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;and the weight of her
      cargo has done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deed thin, an the waves have had somethin to do with that same,&rdquo; said
      Pat; &ldquo;and glad am I that we&rsquo;re all out of her, so I am; and lucky it was
      for us that she didn&rsquo;t go ashore on that same reef, the night of the
      starrum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked on in silence. The work of destruction went on slowly, but
      surely, before their very eyes. Each wave did something towards hastening
      the catastrophe. That the Petrel was doomed was now beyond the possibility
      of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocks were beneath her, and never-ending billows rolled over her, making
      her their prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the fore part of the ship rolled over, with the deck towards
      them, severing itself completely from the other half. The decks gaped
      wide, and opened; the sides started: the foremast came down with a crash,
      and the pitiless waves, rolling on incessantly, flung themselves one after
      the other upon the wreck. The two parts were soon completely severed, the
      fore part breaking up first, the other half resisting more obstinately;
      while the sea was covered with sticks of timber that were torn out from
      her and flung away upon the face of the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the ruin of the fore part was completed, and that part of the
      ship, all torn asunder, with all that part of the cargo, was dissipated
      and scattered over the water and along the beach. The other half still
      clung together, and though sorely bruised and shaken, seemed to put forth
      an obstinate resistance. At every touch of the waves it rolled over only
      to struggle back; it rose up, but was flung down again upon the rocks; it
      seemed to be writhing in agony. At length the mainmast went down with a
      crash, followed not long after by the mizzenmast. Then the fragment of the
      ship suddenly split, and the entire quarterdeck was raised up. Here the
      waves flung themselves, tearing it away from the hull. But before the
      quarter-deck was altogether severed, the rest of the ship gave way, and
      parted in all directions. One by one the huge timber logs were detached
      from her cargo; the separation of the parts of the ship, and the
      dissolution of her compact cargo, gave a greater surface to the action of
      the waves, which now roared, and foamed, and boiled, and seethed, and
      flung themselves in fury over every portion of the disordered, swaying,
      yielding mass. Fragment after fragment was wrenched away; bit by bit the
      strong hull crumbled at the stroke of the mighty billows. The fragments
      were strewn afar over the sea, and along the beach; and the boys saw the
      mizzen-top, where they had found refuge on that eventful night, drifting
      away towards the headland. At length all was over; and in place of the
      Petrel there remained nothing but a vast mass of fragments, strewing the
      rocky shore, and floating over the sea for many a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, however, was the work of hours. The boys watched it all as
      though they were held to the spot by a species of fascination. There
      seemed to be a spell upon them. They could not tear themselves away. But
      at last there was nothing left; nothing but floating fragments; or timbers
      flung by the waves on the shore, with which the waves seemed to play, as
      they hurled them forward and drew them back; while of the Petrel herself
      there was no sign&mdash;no coherent mass, however battered and beaten,
      which might serve to be pointed out as the representative of the ship that
      once bore them all. Of that ship there was nothing left; she was
      dissolved; she was scattered afar; she was no more. Such was the end of
      the Petrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours had passed while the boys were watching there. At length they
      started back to their camp. They walked on in silence. There was a certain
      sadness over all. This sadness arose in part from the scene which they had
      just witnessed, and in part out of their anxiety about Arthur and Tom,
      which now had grown to be serious, since they had seen with their own eyes
      the power of the waves. When the strong ship had yielded, what chance had
      that frail boat? And Arthur and Tom knew very little about navigation.
      Where were they now?
    </p>
    <p>
      With these sad and anxious thoughts, they made their way back, and found
      Solomon in a state of great excitement because they had kept dinner
      waiting. They found that it was past three o&rsquo;clock, and were amazed that
      it was so late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was now served, accompanied by lamentations long and loud from
      Solomon, who protested against such neglect and indifference as they had
      shown, whereby everything had become spoiled from waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now dis yer dinna, chilen, am no common dinna,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I ben makin
      rangements to hab a rail fust-chop, stylish dinna, and hab cocted a new
      dish ob succotash. I took some potted corn an biled it wid the beans, an
      if dat don&rsquo;t make succotash, I don&rsquo; know what do&mdash;dat&rsquo;s all; an dat
      ar succotash, wid de ham, and oysta chowda, an coffee, an game pie, an
      tomato, had ought to make a men-jous good dinna; ought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys said nothing. They were hungry, and they were also sad. For both
      reasons they felt disinclined to speak. They were anxious about Arthur and
      Tom; they also felt mournful about the sad fate of the Petrel; they also
      had dismal forebodings about their own future; but at the same time they
      were most undeniably hungry, ravenously hungry, in fact; and Bruce, who
      was most sad and most anxious, was the hungriest of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all sat down to dinner, and, first of all, they devoted themselves
      to Solomon&rsquo;s succotash. This was a compound of potted corn and dried
      beans; and though the real original succotash is a dish compounded from
      green corn and green beans, yet this was no bad substitute; and they all
      felt, in spite of their sadness, that it was an idea whose originality did
      infinite credit to the culinary genius of Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they had about come to the end of the succotash, and were looking
      about, like Alexander, for more worlds to conquer, or, in other words, for
      more dishes to devour, and were languidly awaiting the next course which
      Solomon might bring, when suddenly a wild cry from Pat roused them all
      from languor to the greatest excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoroo! Thunder and turf!&rdquo; cried Pat; and he sprang to his feet as he
      spoke. &ldquo;Be the powers! but it&rsquo;s fairly dead I am with joy this day. O,
      look! O, look! look, boys! jools! see&rsquo; out there! They&rsquo;re a comin for us&rsquo;
      so they are! We&rsquo;re saved! We&rsquo;re saved! Hooray! Hooray! O, look! It&rsquo;s a
      schooner; she&rsquo;s comin for us; she&rsquo;s goin to take us out o&rsquo; this; and O!
      but it&rsquo;s the bright clever boys that Arthur and Tom are to come back so
      soon, and with a schooner like that same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long before Pat had finished his Irish howl, and while he was yet howling,
      the others had sprung to their feet, and were looking out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, rounding the headland, and bearing down towards them, they saw
      a beautiful schooner, graceful as a pleasure yacht, with all her
      snow-white sails spread wide in spite of the fresh breeze that was
      blowing, as though hurrying towards them to seek and to save. Never had
      they seen a more beautiful craft; but its own proper beauty was now
      increased a hundred fold by the thought that their safety, their rescue,
      their deliverance, was the purpose that guided her here, and that she was
      coming to restore them to home, to friends, and to all the joys of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three cheers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and three more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and three times three, and nine times nine, and cheers without end!
      They cheered. They shouted. They danced. They hugged one another for very
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon joined in the general jubilation. He did this by standing apart
      and bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;&rsquo;Clar, I can&rsquo;t help it, nohow. De
      tears will come, but dey&rsquo;s all tears ob j&rsquo;y. It&rsquo;s ben a drefful tryin time
      to me all along, chilen, dis yer time, for I allus ben a feelin an a
      thinkin as how dat I had some han in a bringin ob you to dese yer
      stremities; but I held out, I bore up, all for your sakes; but now all am
      ober; an O, de precious sakes! dar&rsquo;s a ole man hereabouts, chil&rsquo;en, dat&rsquo;s
      like to bust wid j&rsquo;y! Don&rsquo;t mind me. All right! Hooray! All safe at last!&mdash;an
      de chilen snatched from the jaws ob roonatium! O, do go way now, or else
      dis yer nigga&rsquo;ll bust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at this Solomon really did burst&mdash;into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glorious schooner! the beautiful schooner! the schooner with the
      swan-like form and the snow-white sails! She plunged through the waters,
      the waves foamed about her bows, as she hurried on towards them. Arthur
      and Tom were there; they knew it, or else how should that schooner come so
      straight towards them? No more fears now, no more anxieties. Arthur and
      Tom were both safe, and the deep joy of that little company arose more
      from the assurance of this than even from the prospect of their own
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner came near. She rounded to; she dropped her anchor. A boat was
      lowered. Three figures appeared in the boat&mdash;one rowing with vigorous
      strokes, two smaller ones in the stern. The boat came nearer. In the stern
      they saw the two, and recognized them as they came nearer. They had felt
      sure at the first, but now they saw with their own eyes Arthur and Tom;
      and O, with what joy, with what jubilation, with what shouts, what cries,
      what leaps of joy! Arthur and Tom waved their hands, they stretched out
      their arms, they called out incoherent words, and it was with incoherent
      words that those on the shore responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat grounded. The boys ashore rushed into the water to seize Arthur
      and Tom in their arms. Then the man who had rowed the boat stood up and
      looked at them. They saw him. They knew him. Captain Ferguson! Tears were
      in his eyes, and he tried to hide them, but couldn&rsquo;t. Captain Tobias
      Ferguson, bold sailor, strong, brave man, broke down on this occasion, and
      cried like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went about shaking hands and talking wildly. He grabbed old
      Solomon&rsquo;s hand, and shook it most warmly. He asked anxiously about his
      health. Solomon was still sobbing and crying with utter joy. Neither of
      them knew what he was doing. Both felt the same emotions, yet the emotions
      of each arose from the same cause, and that was, anxiety about these boys,
      whom they loved, for whom they had feared so much, and suffered so much,
      and over whose safety they now rejoiced with such deep joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ferguson did not say much, but made them all get into the boat and
      go aboard the Fawn. He did not look at their camp, nor did they feel any
      regret at leaving the work which had caused them so much toil. Solomon
      only stipulated that he should take away the provisions&mdash;the barrels
      of biscuit, the potted meats, the hams, and whatever else had been
      accumulated there on that desolate shore. Nor was there any reason for
      longer delay, for the associations of the place were by no means of a kind
      which they chose to dwell upon; so the Fawn turned her back upon
      Anticosti, and stood out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed the headland Bruce pointed out to Arthur and Tom the broken
      fragments of the Petrel, which still lined the rocky shore. But the eye of
      Captain Ferguson was turned elsewhere. He was on the lookout for the
      Antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go back after her,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If we wait for her, she won&rsquo;t
      be here till to-morrow morning, and we can run down to where she is in
      less than an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words the Fawn passed outside the headland, and there,
      far away to the east, heading out to sea in one of her tacks, was the
      Antelope. There she was, her very venerable self at last, the schooner for
      which they had so often searched the water, for whose appearance they had
      so longed and hoped, and which never came through all those weary and
      despairing days. Now, when she was not needed, and, in fact, was not
      particularly wanted, she made herself visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind, which was against the Antelope, was fair for the Fawn, and in a
      short time the two schooners were within hail. Captain Corbet then made
      the best of his way on board the Fawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had already seen the boys, and guessed all. When he stood before them
      the boys were all shocked at his appearance. Venerable he had always been,
      but now he looked ten years older than when they last had seen him. He was
      also very much agitated, trembled violently, and, going around, he shook
      hands with every one in silence. Then he turned away his head and wept.
      The boys all felt deeply touched at seeing this exhibition of feeling on
      his part, and even Captain Ferguson looked at him with less severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do believe he&rsquo;s shed a good many tears about you, and
      if he did bring you into a scrape, he&rsquo;s suffered enough for it, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this his treatment of the venerable navigator was far more generous
      than it had hitherto been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got much time to spare,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;captain, but I&rsquo;m bound to see
      these boys in a place of safety. So I propose to sail to Miramichi, and
      you hurry along as fast as your old tub can get through the water. I
      understand you&rsquo;re all going straight back to the Bay of Fundy, and I don&rsquo;t
      see why you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that much safe enough; so I&rsquo;ll deliver
      up the boys to your care in Mirami-chi. I think I can make them
      comfortable enough till then aboard the Fawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet had nothing to say against this decision, but meekly
      returned to the Antelope, and prepared to follow the Fawn to the
      destination mentioned. As for the boys, they were delighted, and felt only
      too glad at being able to have a short cruise on board such a vessel as
      the Fawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day the Fawn reached her destination, but the Antelope
      did not turn up until a day later. The boys now went back to their old
      quarters, and Captain Ferguson bade them all good by. Bailey accompanied
      him, having been engaged by him as one of his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, after Ferguson had taken his departure,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve lived, an we hev suffered, an hev mootooly ben called on to undergo
      triboolations that ain&rsquo;t often met with in this mortual spere. This uthly
      life is one of strange vycissitoods, an the seafarin life has fre-kent ups
      an downs. I don&rsquo;t think I ever, in all my born days, was called upon to
      endoor more pewer mentual tortoor than in this week that&rsquo;s past an gone.
      The wust of it all was the thought that it was my fault, and mine only. So
      now, boys, look at me, and take a warnin. Bewar, above all, of avarice.
      Think of me, with my plans for sudden wealth. Terrew, I might say that it
      was keer for the babby that animated this excited boosom; I might plead
      the affection of a absint feyther a yearnin over his offsprin; but I
      forbar. I pint to my unworthy self, and say, Bewar! Don&rsquo;t ever allow yer
      young minds to grow delooded about the vain and glitterin toys of wealth
      and fortin! See what it&rsquo;s cost us. We derreamed of a great ship, and
      cargo, and thousands upon thousands of pounds to divide among us; and what
      did we railly git? Salvage! farewell, good by to you forever. Out of all
      our derreams we hev gained nothin but the Petrel&rsquo;s boat, which ain&rsquo;t so
      dreadful bad a boat nuther, but contrariwise, and&rsquo;ll be useful enough yet,
      maybe; an if we&rsquo;d quietly taken that thar boat, and ben content, we&rsquo;d a
      ben spard all this trouble, which shows that a small possibility&rsquo;s
      bet-ter&rsquo;n a big impossibility. Them&rsquo;s my sentiments; and among the lessons
      which I hope to live to inculcate in the mind of my babby, the most
      important shall be the story of the ship that we PICKED UP ADRIFT.&rdquo;

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
